The OPEC Reference Basket increased by $6.56, or 15%, month-on-month (m-o-m), to stand at $49.17/b in December. However, in annual terms, the ORB dropped $22.57, or 25%, to average $41.47/b in 2020, which represents the lowest yearly average since 2016. Crude oil futures prices extended their previous month’s surge in December, rising sharply on both sides of the Atlantic. The ICE Brent front month rose by $6.24, or 14.2%, m-o-m in December to average $50.22/b, while NYMEX WTI gained $5.72, or 13.8%, m-o-m to average $47.07/b. As a result, the Brent-WTI spread widened 52¢ to average $3.15/b in December. The price structure of the forward curve strengthened further in December. The ICE Brent stood in shallow backwardation for most of the month, while DME Oman and Dubai remained in strong backwardation. However, the WTI structure remained in contango. Hedge funds and other money managers continued to boost bullish positions, providing additional momentum to the steady ongoing gains in crude oil prices. World Economy Global economic growth was revised up slightly for 2020, after a better-than-expected performance in 3Q20. As a result, the global economy is now expected to contract by 4.1% in 2020, compared to the previous month’s forecast of -4.2%. While the 2021 forecast remains at 4.4%, recent news of fiscal stimulus in the US and the likelihood of a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in Asian economies provide potential upsides for this year’s growth prospects. US economic growth in 2020 was revised slightly higher by 0.1 percentage point (pp) to show a contraction of 3.5%, while the 2021 forecast remains at 3.4%. The Euro-zone forecast was also adjusted slightly higher by 0.1 pp to -7.2%, while the 2021 growth forecast remains at 3.7%. Japan’s figures remain unchanged, contracting by 5.2% in 2020 followed by growth of 2.8% in 2021. China’s economic growth remains at 2.0% in 2020 and at 6.9% in 2021. India is now expected to have seen a shallower contraction of 9.0% in 2020, compared to a previously forecast -9.2%. Expected growth in 2021 remains at 6.8%. Brazil’s economy is now estimated to have contracted by 5.2%, revised up from the previous expectation of -5.8%, while forecast growth in 2021 remains at 2.4%. Russia’s economy is seen contracting by 4.1% in 2020, compared to the previous forecast of -4.5%, while forecast growth in 2021 remains unchanged at 2.9%. World Oil Demand World oil demand growth in 2020 was revised marginally higher from last month’s report and is now estimated to have declined by 9.8 mb/d year-on-year (y-o-y) to average 90.0 mb/d in 2020. OECD America, led by the US, was revised lower particularly in 2H20 amid a sluggish recovery in transportation fuels. In the non-OECD region, oil demand growth was revised higher in 2020, mainly reflecting better-than-expected demand in China and India. Strong petrochemical feedstock demand along with a healthy uptick in gasoline requirements supported the upward revision in both countries. For 2021, global oil demand is forecast to increase by 5.9 mb/d y-o-y to average 95.9 mb/d. The growth forecast was kept unchanged compared to last month’s assessment. In the OECD region, oil consumption is estimated to increase by 2.6 mb/d y-o-y but will still lag pre-pandemic levels. OECD Americas is estimated to increase the most amid a rebound in transportation fuels. In the non-OECD region, oil demand is estimated to increase by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y, driven by China followed by India and Other Asia, and supported by a rebound in economic activities. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids production in 2020 is estimated to average 62.7 mb/d, representing a contraction of 2.5 mb/d, y-o-y. This is broadly unchanged from the previous report, despite several upward and downward revisions in the production of various countries in 4Q20. The oil supply forecast for the US and Brazil was revised down, while the figures for Canada and Russia were adjusted higher due to better-than-expected output in 4Q20. The contraction in 2020 is driven mainly by Russia, the US, Canada and the UK, while production in Norway, Brazil, China, and Guyana is expected to increase. The forecast for non-OPEC supply in 2021 also remains unchanged, with growth expected at 0.8 mb/d. The upward revision in US supply offset the downward revision in the supply forecast for Russia. Market conditions have improved for US shale as oil prices have moved into a range where output is likely to recover at a higher-than-expected rate in 2H21. As a result, the US liquids supply forecast was revised up by around 0.1 mb/d to average just under 18.0 mb/d, OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights representing y-o-y growth of 0.4 mb/d although uncertainties remain. The main contributors to supply growth are expected to be the US, Canada, Brazil and Norway. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by about 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 to average 5.2 mb/d, following an estimated contraction of 0.1 mb/d in 2020. OPEC crude oil production in December increased by 0.28 mb/d, m-o-m, to average 25.36 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Product Markets and Refining Operations Refining margins showed mixed results across the globe in December. The only positive performing region was the US, where margins were supported by strength across the barrel with the exception of fuel oil. Product markets improved on increased transportation activities during the year-end holidays, amid still-suppressed refinery intakes relative to the previous year. In Europe, margins weakened weighed down by stronger crude prices at a time of seasonal weakness with notable losses seen at the top and bottom of the barrel. The hard lockdowns implemented during the month amid pandemic-related concerns exacerbated the pressure on product markets. In Asia, refining margins experienced losses, dragged down by the fuel oil segment as utility sector demand declined. In addition, the surge in crude prices weighed further on Asian refining economics. For the most part, refineries have returned from the peak autumn refinery maintenance season, resulting in a slight rise in available spare capacity globally, awaiting the right incentives to be utilized. Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates experienced a slight improvement in December, while still remaining near historically low levels, amid a persistent imbalance in tanker demand and availability. VLCC and Suezmax rates saw some improvement on eastward rates from the Middle East and West Africa, as well as from West Africa to the US Gulf Coast. Meanwhile, Aframax rates declined, weighed down by a sluggish intra-Med performance. Clean tanker rates continued to pick up in December from multi-year lows seen in at the start of the fourth quarter, with gains both East and West of Suez. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports averaged 5.6 mb/d in December, resulting in an annual average of 5.9 mb/d in 2020, the lowest since 1991. US crude exports ended the year averaging just below 3 mb/d in December, down from a record high of 3.7 mb/d in February 2020. In annual terms, US crude exports averaged 3.1 mb/d in 2020 for a y-o-y increase of 0.2 mb/d. The latest data shows Japan’s crude imports recovered for the second month in a row to average 2.3 mb/d in November, reflecting winter demand, but were still sharply lower y-o-y, declining 22%. China’s crude imports averaged 11.1 mb/d in November, recovering from a decline the month before as a backlog of inflows continued to clear customs. Preliminary data shows crude imports declining m-o-m in December. China’s product imports recovered in November from the weak performance in the previous month, averaging 1.3 mb/d, while product exports fell back from the relatively high level seen in the previous month to average almost 1.3 mb/d. India’s crude imports jumped 24% to an eight-month high, averaging 4.5 mb/d in November, as an easing of lockdown measures led refineries to boost runs. Both product imports and exports increased in November to average around 1.0 mb/d, respectively. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data shows total OECD commercial oil stocks down by 24.5 mb, m-o-m, in November. At 3,104 mb, inventories were 205.1 mb higher than the same period a year ago and 163.1 mb above the latest five-year average. Within the components, crude and products stocks declined, m-o-m, by 11.2 mb and 13.3 mb, respectively. At 1,546 mb, OECD crude oil stocks are 98.4 mb higher than the same time a year ago, and 72.6 mb above the latest five-year average. Total product inventories stood at 1,558 mb, some 106.7 mb above the same period a year ago, and 90.5 mb higher than the latest five-year average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks fell, m-o-m, by 1.6 days to stand at 70.5 days in November. This is 8.8 days above the November 2019 level and 8.5 days above the latest five-year average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2020 remained unchanged from the previous report to stand at 22.2 mb/d, around 7.1 mb/d lower than in 2019. Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 remained unchanged from the previous report to stand at 27.2 mb/d, around 5.0 mb/d higher than in 2020. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Monetary policies and their impact on the oil market Oil markets faced an unprecedented volatile environment in 2020, impacted massively by COVID-19 and its ensuing demand collapse, necessitating considerable reactions by policy makers. At one point in April, a confluence of factors even pushed WTI futures into negative territory for the first time in the history of the oil market. In response, OPEC and non-OPEC countries under the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) met in the same month to reach another landmark decision to stabilise and rebalance oil markets. This impressive effort was also commended by the G20 at their extraordinary Energy Minsters’ Meeting in April. At the same time, central banks across the world stepped up their efforts to provide sufficient liquidity and to stem the negative impact of lockdowns. These monetary interventions provided the financial basis for a swift recovery in the global economy, which also had a positive effect on oil markets. Among the central banks of the major developed Graph 1: Central Bank assets (US, Euro Area and Japan) economies, the US Federal Reserve provided a large % of GDP stimulus, cutting interest rates by 150 basis points to 140 around zero in March. Meanwhile, the European 120 Japan Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ), left Euro Area their policy rates unchanged, as these were already 100 US effectively at zero, or even slightly negative. 80 However, all of them engaged in considerable 60 expansion of their balance sheet to assist access to 40 credit (Graph 1). These looser monetary policies 20 helped to restore calm in government and corporate credit markets, including the energy credit market, 0 4Q 09 which had been very distressed in March. 2Q 10 4Q 10 2Q 11 4Q 11 2Q 12 4Q 12 2Q 13 4Q 13 2Q 14 4Q 14 2Q 15 4Q 15 2Q 16 4Q 16 2Q 17 4Q 17 2Q 18 4Q 18 2Q 19 4Q 19 While fiscal deficits, and hence public debt, 2Q 20 Sources: BEA, Fed, ECB, BoJ, CAO and Haver Analytics. increased substantially across major developed economies – for example in the US alone, public debt rose by $2.8 trillion during 2Q20 – the low interest rate resulted in lower cost of service for the newly issued debt and hence alleviated concerns of being able to sustain this debt. The combination of stabilising oil prices and lower cost of debt has also helped energy producers. Another area particularly impacted by central banks’ interventions was currency markets. The intervention by the Federal Reserve resulted in the US dollar depreciating against its major counterparts, following an initial spike in March. This has been especially helpful for emerging markets, which have the majority of their foreign currency debt denominated in the US dollar, and whose financial markets are more vulnerable to capital outflows in times of crisis. In the past, a gradually weakening US dollar has also been supportive to oil prices and oil producing exporters. In the meantime, monetary policy makers stated that Graph 2: Composite CPI advanced economies both monetary and fiscal support are necessary to % change y-o-y achieve a sustained recovery. Furthermore, 3.5 considering the increase in forced savings by 3.0 consumers during lockdowns, the positive impact of 2.5 public investment to compensate for the shortfall in 2.0 household demand could be stronger than expected. 1.5 1.0 With this, the combination of monetary, fiscal and oil 0.5 market-related policies may support central banks’ efforts to achieve their inflation targets, which have 0.0 been rarely met since the global financial crisis -0.5 Oct 09 May 10 (Graph 2). However, it should be noted that the Dec 10 Jul 11 Feb 12 Sep 12 Apr 13 Nov 13 Jun 14 Jan 15 Aug 15 expectation of further fiscal stimulus in the US, in Mar 16 Oct 16 May 17 Dec 17 Jul 18 Feb 19 Sep 19 Apr 20 combination with a recovery in the global economy, Source: Haver Analytics. may lead to the re-emergence of a spike in key market interest rates as experienced in 2013. Therefore, markets may expect monetary policy to begin tightening earlier than anticipated, which would have a potentially negative effect on the global economy and oil markets. In their continued efforts to support the global economic recovery, the countries participating in the DoC undertook tremendous measures to stabilize the global oil market, most recently at the beginning of January 2021. Together with the various national fiscal and monetary stimulus measures, the decisions reached by the DoC to rebalance the oil market will provide further upside potential for economic recovery in 2021 and make monetary policy efforts by central banks more effective.

Expectations of a gradual lifting of mobility restrictions and accelerating demand recovery also contributed to the rebound. Improving refining margins, declining crude floating storage, and strong conformity to production adjustments from the DoC producers added further support to the market. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) ended 2020 higher m-o-m, surging $6.56, or 15%, to settle at $49.17/b in December, its highest monthly value since February 2020. However, on a yearly average, the ORB value fell by $22.57, or 25.2%, in 2020 to $41.47/b, the lowest yearly average since 2016. Crude oil futures prices extended their surge in December and rose sharply on both sides of the Atlantic to reach their highest levels since last February. Investors turned more positive about an economic rebound and a rapid recovery of oil demand following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in several countries. Futures prices rose alongside equities following the approval of additional economic stimulus packages in the US and in Europe. Market optimism strengthened amid the brightening outlook for the global oil market balance after DoC producers decided in early December to voluntarily adjust their production modestly from January, and also agreed to extend the compensation period. The ICE Brent front month increased by $6.24, or 14.2%, in December to average $50.22/b, and NYMEX WTI rose by $5.72, or 13.8%, to average $47.07/b. However, y-t-d, ICE Brent was $20.95, or 32.7%, lower and stood at $43.21/b, while NYMEX WTI was $17.70, or 31.0%, lower at $39.34/b compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices increased in December by $6.10 m-o-m, or 13.9%, to settle at $50.13/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was lower by $20.96, or 32.8%, at $43.03/b. Hedge funds and other money managers continued to boost bullish wagers and to close out more bearish positions in December. Combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI rose to their highest level since January 2020. The futures price structure strengthened further in December and the front of ICE Brent forward curve was in backwardation most of the month, while DME Oman and Dubai price structures remained in strong backwardation. However, the NYMEX WTI structure was in contango. Nonetheless, the first to third month also flipped to shallow backwardation in recent days. The value of light-sweet crude strengthened in December against the value of medium and heavy-sour crude in Europe and in the Asia Pacific, while in the USGC, the sweet-sour crude differential remained narrow and largely steady m-o-m.

The improving refining margins in the main markets and the strengthening of road transportation fuel cracks also added support to spot crude prices in December. All physical crude oil benchmarks rose m-o-m in OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements December, with North Sea Dated rising the most among the other main spot benchmarks, increasing by $7.20, or 16.9%, to average $49.74/b. The WTI and Dubai first month rose respectively by $5.53 and $6.45, or 13.3% and 14.9%, to settle at $47.05/b and $49.78/b. North Sea physical crude values strengthened on strong buying interest and higher shipment of North Sea crude towards the Asian market, which reduced regional crude floating storage and availability. The Forties crude differential, the largest stream in the Brent basket, saw its value rise by 62¢ on average in December, to settle at a premium of 21¢/b against the Brent benchmark, compared to a discount of 41¢/b in November. The value of the Ekofisk crude differential rose by 47¢, to average at a premium of 57¢/b in December. Despite a flurry of purchase tenders from Asian refiners, the continued shipment of West African crude to the East and strong buying interest from Asia Pacific refiners, particularly those in India, the value of West African crude differentials were mixed in December. The strengthening Brent futures structure also kept downward pressure on the regional crude differential values. Crude differentials of Bonny light, Forcados and Qua Iboe eased on a monthly average in December by 1¢, 20¢ and 8¢, respectively. The value of Urals crude differentials also weakened in December in the Mediterranean and in Northwest Europe due to weak demand for the grade. In the USGC, crude differentials strengthened further on a monthly average in December on healthy demand from regional refiners and sustained exports. The WTI Houston crude differential against NYMEX WTI rose 73¢ in December on average, to a premium of $1.52/b. The value of Dubai-related crudes in the Middle East also rose in December, supported by firm demand from China and India, as most Asian refiners were securing their crude needs. In the Middle East spot market, the value of crude differentials of Oman rose by 13¢, to a premium of 75¢/b, while Upper Zakum crude differentials fell by 15¢ to a premium of 7¢/b.

The ORB rose for the second consecutive month on higher related benchmark crude prices amid signs of improving oil market fundamentals. However, on a yearly average, the ORB value fell by $22.57, or 25.2%, in 2020 to $41.47/b, the lowest yearly average since 2016. All ORB component values strengthened in December, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend and Zafiro – rising $7.39, or 17.9% m-o-m on average, to $48.74/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy and Kuwait Export – increased by $6.45, or 15.0% m-o-m on average, to settle at $49.44/b. Murban crude rose by $6.39, or 14.8% m-o-m on average, to settle at $49.48/b. Merey component also rose by $5.63, or 20.8% m-o-m on average, to settle at 32.70/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices extended their surge in December and rose sharply on both sides of the Atlantic to reach their highest levels since February 2020 on a monthly average, with ICE Brent first month surpassing the $50/b threshold. In December, ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI jumped 14.2% and 13.8%, respectively, on a monthly average as investors turned more positive about an economic rebound and a rapid recovery of oil demand following the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines in several regions, while more countries were approving different vaccines. Oil prices also rose on signs of firm crude oil demand in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically in China and India. The market consolidated further amid the brightening global oil market balance outlook after OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries in the DoC decided in early December to voluntary adjust their production modestly from January this year, and also agreed to extend the compensation period. US crude oil stocks declined for three consecutive weeks in December, falling by about 10 mb, and provided further support to crude oil prices. Investors also remained optimistic about an additional US fiscal stimulus package, while the European Central Bank (ECB) announced more stimulus measures, which should support the economy and energy demand. The post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU, which was reached on 24 December, also boosted market confidence. Moreover, the weakening of the US dollar’s value against a basket of other currencies to its lowest level in about two and a half years also added support to crude oil prices, and commodities in general. Nonetheless, the oil price surge slowed in the second part of the month on concerns about a new variant of the COVID-19 virus in the UK and in other countries, which could lead to more lockdowns and mobility restrictions and consequently curb oil demand. The market was also assessing the different agencies’ forecasts that pointed to slower-than-expected global oil demand growth for 2021, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that the impact of the vaccines on demand for oil will take several months.

On 13 January, ICE Brent stood at $56.06/b and NYMEX WTI at $52.91/b. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened again in December for the second consecutive month, averaging above $3/b, as the international futures benchmark Brent rose more than NYMEX WTI at Cushing, Oklahoma. The value of Brent strengthened on continued easing of the supply overhang and declining floating storage in the Atlantic Basin, thanks to robust demand from the Asia-Pacific region. However, the increase of the WTI price slowed amid the high level of crude oil stocks at Cushing, Oklahoma, which remained at about 58 mb on average during the four weeks of December, according to US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. Furthermore, US refinery utilization remained low on average at about 79% of operable capacity during the four weeks of December, according to the EIA weekly data, although the rate increased slightly on monthly average. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened by 52¢ m-o-m to average $3.15/b in December, compared to $2.63/b in November. The spread between North Sea Dated and WTI Houston's first month also widened in December, and the value of North Sea Dated was $1.15/b higher than WTI Houston on a monthly average, compared to a premium of 22¢/b in November. Meanwhile, US crude oil exports were little changed m-o-m in December, falling to 2.8 mb/d on average, based on the EIA’s weekly data. Hedge funds and other money managers continued to boost bullish wagers and to close out more bearish positions in December, with combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI rising to their highest level since January 2020, providing additional momentum to the ongoing steady gains in crude oil prices. Speculators’ bets on higher oil prices increased significantly on expectation of improving global oil market fundamentals, driven by the relatively rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines as well as solid conformity of the DoC countries to their oil production adjustments. Nonetheless, speculators slowed their purchases in the second part of December, amid mixed developments in the pandemic situation worldwide, and were waiting for news about a new US economic stimulus package, as well as the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in early January. By the end of the week of 22 December, money managers held net long positions equivalent to about 617 mb in the two main crude oil futures and options contracts, the highest level since January 2020. Hedge funds were net buyers of about 72 mb between the week ending 24 November and the week of 29 December 2020, a rise of 13.4%. Money managers continued to increase their bullish positions in ICE Brent in December to reach their highest since last February on anticipation of improving market conditions in the coming weeks and increasing crude prices. After an increase of 160.5% in November, combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent rose by a further 34,434 contracts, or 14.0%, between the week of 01 December and the week of 29 December to reach 280,298 lots, according to the ICE Exchange. During the same period, gross short positions declined by 18,237 lots, or 28.3%, to 46,190 contracts, and long positions rose by 16,197 lots, or 5.2%, to 326,488 contracts. Hedge funds and money managers also raised their net long positions related to NYMEX WTI in December but at a slower rate compared to ICE Brent. During the four weeks of December, speculators increased their related NYMEX WTI net long positions by 0.9%, or 2,879 contracts, to stand at 333,784 lots in the week of 29 December. This is due to a decline in short positions by 9,650 lots, or 15.6%, to 52,227 contracts, and a decline of 6,771 contracts, or 1.7%, in long positions, to 386,011 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract rose to 7:1 in the week to 29 December, its highest since January 2020, compared to 5:1 in the week to 01 December. Similarly, the 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio rose to 7:1 in week to 29 December, compared to 6:1 in the week to 01 December, reflecting the prospects of improving oil market fundamentals. Total futures and options open interest volumes on the two exchanges rose in December, increasing by 2.6%, or 142,151 contracts, to stand at 5.5 million contracts in the week ending 29 December. The futures market structure The futures price structure strengthened further in December and the front of the ICE Brent forward curve stood in backwardation most of the month. The DME Oman and Dubai price structures remained in backwardation, reflecting expectations of tighter sour supplies, a more balanced oil market and lower global crude oil inventory levels, specifically global floating storage. These movements are mainly due to the production adjustments by OPEC and participating non-OPEC producers in the DoC and the gradual recovery of oil demand, mainly in the Asia-Pacific region. The NYMEX WTI forward curve improved slightly in December, through it remained in contango, mirroring supply/demand market fundamentals in and around the US trading hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. Global benchmark Brent's forward curve flattened in December and the ICE Brent M1-M3 slipped into backwardation most of the month as near-month prices were supported by robust demand for prompt-loading barrels, particularly from the Asia Pacific, which has helped more crude in the Atlantic Basin moving to the East, declining floating storage and an easing of the supply overhang in the Atlantic Basin. The back end of the Brent forward curve steepened further over the month on prospects of a more balanced global crude market, gradual oil demand recovery after the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, and easing of global oil stocks. The ICE Brent M1M3 spread narrowed further in December by 41¢, on average, from a contango of 42¢/b in November, to a contango of only 1¢/b in December.

DME Oman and Dubai backwardation structures consolidated more last month, signalling continued strong demand for spot cargoes and tightening supply, as refiners secured their needs for sour crude for the coming months amid restrained supplies due to the production adjustments by participating DoC producers. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 backwardation was little changed m-o-m in December, widening only 1¢ to 56¢/b on average, from a backwardation of 55¢/b in November. In the US, the structure of NYMEX WTI flattened in December and the front month spread’s contango narrowed on a monthly average, reflecting an easing of the supply overhang in the US market. The decline of US crude oil stocks for three consecutive weeks in December and some recovery in US crude runs contributed to pushing prompt month prices higher compared to forward months. The NYMEX WTI M1-M3 contango narrowed in December by 27¢/b m-o-m, to 27¢/b, compared to a contango of 54¢/b in November. Nonetheless, the first to third month flipped to shallow backwardation in recent days. Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread flipped to a backwardation of 9¢/b in December on a monthly average, compared to a contango of 47¢/b in November. In the US, the WTI M1/M3 contango widened in December by 26¢ to 28¢/b compared to a contango of 54¢/b in November. However, the Dubai M1/M3 monthly average spread widened to a backwardation of 52¢/b on average in December, from a backwardation of 12¢/b in November, or an increase of 40¢. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Crude spreads The value of light sweet crude in December strengthened against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in Europe and in the Asia Pacific, despite ongoing restrained sour crude supplies due to the DoC supply adjustments. Nonetheless, the spread remained narrow when compared to levels before the COVID-19 crisis. In the USGC, the sweet-sour crude differential remained narrow and largely steady m-o-m. In Europe, the value of sour grade Urals priced at a Graph 1 7: Differential in Europe, Asia and USGC premium level on average in December against the US$/b light sweet benchmark North Sea Dated, although this 40 premium narrowed by 48¢ to 33¢/b on average in December, compared to a premium of 81¢/b in 20 November. The narrowing of the Urals-Dated spread was due to firm light sweet crude value in the Atlantic 0 Basin, including in the North Sea and West African markets, which were bolstered by strong buying -20 interest from Asian refiners and increasing crude shipments from the Atlantic Basin to the East Suez Dec 19 Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 markets. In the meantime, the value of sour crude in Europe came under further pressure in the second part Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals of December due to softening demand for the grade LLS-Mars as most refiners had already secured their needs, in Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. addition to higher January loading programmes for Urals. In the Mediterranean, crude differentials of Urals remained at premium level to Brent in December. In the Northwest Europe, Urals crude differentials fell to a discount against Brent for most part of the month. In Asia, the value of light sweet Tapis crude to the sour benchmark Dubai continued to recover for a third month and rose firmly in December by $1.98 on average to settle at a premium of $1.07/b, compared to a discount of 91¢/b in November. The value of light sweet crude in the Asia Pacific increased on strong demand from regional refiners and firmer refining margins of light distillate products like naphtha, while weaker fuel oil margins in almost all regions put some pressure on sour crude value. Higher crude differentials for North Sea and West African crudes also made similar grades in the Asia Pacific, like Tapis, more attractive to Asian buyers. Furthermore, the Brent/Dubai Exchange of Futures for Swaps widened to its highest since last February on a monthly average, to stand at 86¢/b, and this made the domestic Asian grades more attractive to regional refiners despite the arbitrage flows of similar barrels from the North Sea, West Africa and USGC. In the USGC, the Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) premium over medium sour Mars remained narrow, below $1/b, in December and was little changed m-o-m, widening only 1¢ on a monthly average to stand at 92¢/b. This was due to the tight global sour crude market and, in the USGC, sustained demand for sour crude for export. The deep-water Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System (CHOPS) that transports sour crude from Louisiana to Texas City and Port Arthur has remained offline since August 2020. High availability of light sweet crude in the US market and a narrow Brent-WTI spread that limited arbitrage opportunity also contributed to keeping the sweetsour crude spread narrow. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodity prices generally performed strongly in December, led by a 15% rise in oil prices. This came against the backdrop of rising optimism in financial markets amid the start of COVID-19 vaccination program and the expectation of additional fiscal stimulus in the US. In Asia, prices of natural gas and coal were supported by colder than average weather. Natural gas price movements were mixed in the Atlantic basin, rising in Europe, on top of cold weather and rising LNG prices in Asia, but declined in the US amid mild weather. Base metals prices rose strongly, supported by concerns regarding supply disruptions, continuing expansion in global manufacturing and the bullish financial investor sentiment. In the group of precious metals, gold prices declined slightly on reduced safe haven demand. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index advanced by around 15.0% m-o-m in December, as happened in the previous month, led by rising crude oil and coal prices. The average index level was down by 31.7% in 2020 compared with 2019. The non-energy index rose m-o-m by 4.7%, with a strong performance for base metals, which rose by 7.2%, while the agriculture indexes rose by 2.1%. In 2020, the non-energy index was up by 3.0% compared to the previous year.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In December, the Henry Hub natural gas index decreased on average by 2% m-o-m to $2.5/mmbtu. Prices weakened as a result of mild temperatures and the recovery in domestic production, which was estimated to decline by just 4% y-o-y at the end of the month according to IHS Markit. However, similar to what occurred in the previous month, strong demand for LNG exports, which was estimated at around 11 bcf/d, limited the downside. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities withdrew 130 bcf from working gas underground storage during the week ending 1 January 2021. This withdrawal left total working gas in underground storage at 3,330 bcf, which was 6.4% above the latest five-year average. At the end of November, this was 7.9% above the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe rose strongly with the average Title Transfer Facility price up by 21.1% m-o-m to 5.9/mmbtu. This development was supported by cold weather, in the first half of the month, and strong Asia LNG prices, which averaged $11/mmbtu in December, thereby favouring exports to that region instead of Europe. However, lockdown measures restrained demand, limited a further price spike. European Union inventories ended the month of December around 74.1% full from around 88% full at the end of the previous month, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Last year, inventories were 88% full at the end of December. Australian thermal coal prices rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, increasing by 28.9% m-o-m to average a 20 month high of $83.0/mt, mainly supported by colder than average winter temperatures in North East Asia, and strong economic activity. In main consumer China, thermal power generation was already strong in November, increasing by 6.6% y-o-y, and it was slightly up by 0.3% in the January-November period compared to the same period of 2019, according to China National Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile the growth in coal output by 1.5% y-o-y in November has been limited in comparison. While Chinese imports of Australian coal have been restricted, the colder weather and strong price of natural gas results in higher support for demand in alternative destinations.

The base metal price index rose by 7.2% m-o-m in December, and ended the year 21% higher than in December 2019 with a further acceleration in global manufacturing activity. As was the case in the previous month, improving investor sentiment after the announcement about vaccines, the expectations of additional fiscal stimulus in the US and a weaker US dollar continued to support price gains. Average monthly copper prices rose in December by almost 10% m-o-m to $7,068/mt, amid a further drop in stocks, rising investor bullishness and some concerns about disruption to mining operations in major producer Peru. According to International Copper Study Group (ICGS) estimates, the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the January-to-September 2020 period showed a deficit of 354,000 versus a 296,000 deficit in the January-August estimation. Meanwhile in December, inventories at London Metal Exchange (LME)-designated warehouses experienced a large drop to 107,950 tonnes from 149,800 in November, underscoring a tight market. Iron ore prices rose in December by 25% m-o-m to around $155.4/mt. This was 68% higher than December 2019 average, and it was one of the commodities with the largest price appreciation during the last 12 months. Prices supported by strong demand for steel making in China, and fears of supply disruption due to severe weather in Australia and Indonesia this year, and concerns about mine safety in Brazil, could affect output in the country as happened in 2019. Chinese steel output was up by 8.0 % y-o-y in November, and by 5.5% in the Jan-Nov period according to World Steel Association. In the group of precious metals, gold was down by 0.4% m-o-m in December following some decline in safe haven demand, but strengthened towards the end of the month as real interest rates declined. Silver prices meanwhile rose by 12.8%, while platinum prices rose by 3.7%. Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ net length increased moderately in NYMEX WTI crude oil, gold and copper, both in absolute terms and as a share of the open interest (OI).

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 9 World Economy World Economy While a strong global economic recovery in 2021 remains very likely, the depth and magnitude of this year’s rebound remains uncertain. New virus variants have emerged, there is still a considerable rise in infections – particularly in Western economies – and vaccination programmes in numerous large economies are off to a slow start, factors which may cloud the recovery at least for 1Q21. While upside potential exists, the 2021 global economic growth forecast remains unchanged at 4.4%. Further insights in the coming weeks will help create a better understanding of the global economy’s near-term path, and the forecast will be thoroughly reviewed once more in the coming month. In the meantime, slightly better-than-anticipated 3Q20 growth, particularly in the emerging economies, lifted the 2020 global growth estimate from a decline of 4.2% to minus 4.1%. Ongoing pandemic-related challenges are forecast to dampen the recovery, but are considered temporary, especially as distribution of vaccines, along with other pandemic-related improvements, are forecast to gain traction. Widely available rapid-testing facilities will play an important role in addition to the vaccines. Therefore, the recovery is forecast to gain steam towards the end of 2Q21. Momentum is expected to be led by consumer spending, especially in the contact-intensive services sector and particularly in the areas of travel, leisure and hospitality. The seasonal aspect of warm weather in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer travel season will add more support. Forced household savings from lockdowns, combined with ongoing monetary and likely additional fiscal stimulus, will add to the rebound. In such an environment it is likely that rising investments will provide an additional pillar to growth. In geographic terms, the upside to the current forecast comes mainly from further US growth, an acceleration of India’s recovery, and strongerthan-anticipated growth in China amid once-again rising global trade and improving domestic activity in that country. Additional virus variants and the potential that vaccines could be less effective against them pose major risks to the expected recovery. The OECD growth forecast for 2020 remains at -5.3%, after slight upward revisions in the US and the Eurozone and a strong downward revision in the UK, amid ongoing weak growth and in the meantime a finalised Brexit. OECD growth in 2021 is unchanged from the previous month at 3.5%. In the emerging economies, India’s 2020 GDP growth was revised up to -9.0% from -9.2%. For the time being, the growth forecast for 2021 is unchanged at 6.8%. China’s GDP growth forecast is unchanged at 2.0% for 2020 and 6.9% for 2021. Brazil’s 2020 GDP growth forecast was revised up to -5.2% compared to -5.8% the previous month. The Brazilian economy is forecast to grow by 2.4% in 2021, unchanged from the previous month. Russia’s 2020 GDP was revised up to stand at -4.1% after previously reaching -4.5%. The 2021 recovery is forecast to remain unchanged at 2.9%, with some potential upside to the country in connection with the ongoing DoC process.

The GDP numbers have been adjusted to reflect 2017 ppp. Source: OPEC. Global Update on latest developments In several major economies, updates to 3Q20 GDP growth showed better-than-expected recovery. Both the US and the Euro-zone have revised up their 3Q20 numbers, while economies such as Brazil and Russia have seen a considerable uptick in 3Q20, following previously announced improving 3Q20 numbers from China and India. This momentum was led by the manufacturing sector, while the contact-intensive services sector is still impacted by the consequences of the global pandemic. Growth was lifted via extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus measures across the globe. In addition, forced private household savings in 1H20, mainly in OECD economies, supported pent-up demand in 3Q20. However, the latest rise in COVID-19 infections has again 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Economy led to renewed lockdown measures and voluntary social distancing. Thus, economic activity already softened in 4Q20, as can be seen in the most recent available indicators from November and December, and is expected to continue to do so in 1Q20. Ongoing monetary stimulus and additional fiscal measures in the US and the Euro-zone will provide major support going forward. In the US, additional stimulus of around $900 billion was announced, while in the Euro-zone the approval of a 750-billion-euro rescue fund will also provide a sound pillar for momentum going forward. Global largesse in terms of fiscal stimulus has come at the price of rising debt levels, leading to very high total debt-to-GDP ratios in advanced economies, as well as in emerging and developing economies. This will require close monitoring in the near term. Moreover, new virus variants have emerged lately and the still considerable rise in infections, particularly in western economies, along with a slow start to vaccination programmes in numerous large economies, have clouted the recovery so far in 1Q21, especially in OECD economies. As a consequence of the global recovery, global Graph 3 1: Global trade trade levels continued improving, according to data % change y-o-y available up to October.

Near-term expectations While 1Q21 developments have been dented so far by rising COVID-19 infections and additional lockdown measures in most major OECD economies, the situation in emerging economies seems to have slightly improved lately. However, infection developments also warrant close attention in these economies. Current pandemic-related challenges are considered to be temporary, as the distribution of a vaccine, along with other pandemic-related improvements, are forecast to gain traction. The expectation of a broadening in rapid-testing facilities in the near-term will play an important role, in addition to a vaccine. Therefore, the recovery is forecast to gain traction towards the end of 2Q21. Momentum is expected to be led by consumer spending, especially in the contact-intensive services sector, and particularly in the areas of travel, leisure and hospitality. The seasonal aspect of warm weather in the northern hemisphere and the travel season at that time will provide additional support factors. Forced household savings from lockdowns, in combination with ongoing monetary and likely additional fiscal stimulus, especially in the US, will add to the rebound. In such an environment it is likely that rising investment will provide an additional pillar to growth. In geographic terms, the upside to the current forecast comes mainly from further US growth, an acceleration of India’s recovery, and stronger-thananticipated growth in China amid once-again rising global trade and improving domestic activity in that country. In general, economic activity will depend on how Graph 3 2: Global PMI successfully COVID-19 is contained through the Index distribution of effective vaccines, hygiene measures, 60 improving treatment, increasing COVID-19-related 53.8 health care infrastructure and, importantly, widely 50 51.8 available rapid testing facilities.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 11 World Economy With further improvement seen, particularly in the Table 3 2: World economic growth rate and revision, emerging economies, the 2020 GDP growth 2020–2021*, % forecast was revised up to stand at -4.1%, compared World to -4.2% the previous month.

However, momentum will gain traction towards the end of 2Q21 and is forecast to pick up in 2H21. Additional upside potential may come from further US fiscal stimulus, an acceleration of India’s recovery and a strongerthan-anticipated growth dynamic in China amid once-again rising global trade and improving domestic activity. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments The strong recovery in 3Q20 GDP growth has seen further upward revision. In its third and final release on 3Q20 GDP growth, the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed growth of 33.4% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) compared to the previous estimate of 33.1%. While private household consumption was a major contributor, with a growth rate of 41%, the end of important social welfare programmes as part of 2020 fiscal stimulus packages obviously negatively impacted consumer confidence in 4Q20. Consumer confidence retracted again in December, standing as measured by the Conference Board at 88.6, compared to 92.9 in November and 101.4 in October. Consequently, retail sales retracted in value terms, but still held up well with a growth rate of 4.5% y-o-y in November. This comes at a time when labour market improvements are stalling and COVID-19 infections continue to rise. In this environment, the recently announced stimulus package of around $900 billion was indeed of great importance in order for a sustainable rebound to continue. Income-dependent direct payments are included, most likely supporting consumer sentiment going forward. Moreover, the important wealth factors of equity and housing markets continued to perform very well. This was strongly supported by intensive monetary stimulus, as the Fed increased its balance sheet volume by more than $3 trillion in 2020. US industrial sector activity was also impacted by the Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market tentative slowdown in November, contracting by 5.5% % % y-o-y compared to a decline of 5% y-o-y in October. 64 16 This translates into a monthly increase of 0.4% y-o-y 63 61.5 12 in November, after a rise of 1% y-o-y was seen in 62 October.

Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations After a strong recovery in 3Q20 and a slow-down in 4Q20, the US economy’s growth dynamic is forecast to gain traction in 2021. This year is being kick-started by additional fiscal stimulus of around $900 billion and further stimulus is expected, along with improving COVID-19 containment, thus the recovery is forecast to gain traction over the year. While 1Q21 is forecast to remain impacted by COVID-19-related social-distancing 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Economy measures, holding GDP growth at 2% q-o-q SAAR, growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.8% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21 and to more than 3% SAAR on a quarterly average in 2H21. This is forecast to be led by consumer spending and investment. Positively, effective containment, in combination with well-targeted stimulus measures, could further lift the current 2021 growth forecast pattern. Rising debt levels may cause some concern going forward. This will require close monitoring, but is not expected to pose an imminent challenge. Importantly, the forecast does not anticipate the broad-based penetration of vaccinations in the US before 2H20. From a quarterly perspective, this will also be the period when most of next year’s pick-up will materialise. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to continue its flexible approach regarding monetary policy to counterbalance COVID-19’s effects. The economy’s recovery is reflected in December Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and PMI levels as provided by the Institute for Supply non-manufacturing indices Management (ISM), indicating a pick-up in the coming Index months. The manufacturing PMI rose to 60.7 in 65 December, compared to 57.5 in November and 59.3 60 60.7 in October.

OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Euro-zone continues to be affected by rising COVID-19 infections, despite the reintroduction of lockdown measures in November and December and extended into 1Q21. The combined impact on domestic consumption is strong, though less so than in the first period of lockdowns in 1H21. In this environment, it was positive to see that the EU budget, including the addition of fiscal stimulus measures through a rescue fund, was agreed in December. This provides the EU with 750 billion euros to help the most challenged economies in the Euro-zone overcome the current challenges. The latest GDP data published by Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, confirms that the Euro-zone recovered strongly in 3Q20. GDP growth in 3Q20 was reported at 12.5% q-o-q on a seasonally adjusted (SA) basis, while the annualized rate stood at 60%. However, the lockdown actions that were reinstated in 4Q20 are expected to cause a deceleration towards the end of the year and carry over into 1Q21. As a response to this slowdown, the European Central Bank (ECB) increased its accommodative monetary policy measures at its December meeting, when the ECB announced that it would increase the size of its pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) to 1.85 trillion euros and that it would extend this programme to at least March 2022. Importantly, the major uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations has been overcome, with the EU and the UK reaching an agreement on 24 December.

Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations After the strong 60% annualized quarterly growth in 3Q20, 4Q20 GDP is expected to decline by almost 10%. The ongoing stringent lockdown measures in combination with voluntary social distancing is forecast to considerably impact growth again in 1Q21. The continuation of lockdown measures, rising infections in most Euro-zone economies, and the slow start of vaccination programmes is expected to weigh on 1Q21 growth, before an acceleration of growth that is forecast to kick in by the end of 2Q21. The ECB’s additional monetary stimulus, in combination with the distribution of the 750-billion-euro rescue fund, will help support the gradual recovery in 2021. The underlying assumptions are that vaccinations will Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs be gradually distributed and that at the same time the Index extension of rapid testing facilities will support the 60 55.2 gradual normalisation of social activities with a 50 consequent positive effect on the travel and 46.4 transportation, leisure and hospitality sectors.

By the end of 2Q21 the growth should gain traction with an anticipated improvement in the COVID-19 situation amid the expected wide availability of vaccines. While a successful containment of COVID-19 along with further improvements in the global economy may provide upside to economic growth, the 2021 GDP growth forecast remains unchanged at 3.7%. 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Economy OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments The latest data shows that the solid 3Q20 recovery seems to have slowed down somewhat in 4Q20, albeit at a sound level of growth. As in other major OECD economies, the rebound was supported by the recovery in manufacturing as a consequence of the improvement in global trade. Japan’s exports have recovered in recent months, providing solid support to the Japanese economy via various spill over effects. Domestic developments have been less supportive. The recent surge in COVID-19 cases, especially in Tokyo, has led to new lockdown and social-distancing measures, which have already negatively impacted the 1Q21 dynamic. The Japanese government’s latest GDP data revisions confirm a sharp slowdown in 1H20 with a strong rebound materialising in 3Q20. After a decline of 2.1% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q20 and a contraction of 29.2% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q20, growth recovered to 22.9% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q20. Most indicators point to a continuation of the recovery and a better-than-expected development in 2H20. However, slowing retail sales growth has pointed to ongoing challenges in domestic demand. While of less importance, the unemployment rate fell to 2.9% in November. Industrial production improved on a monthly basis, rising by 0.2% m-o-m in November, compared to 3.3% m-o-m in October. This translates into a decline of 2.4% y-o-y, compared to a decline of 3.2% y-o-y in October. While exports have recovered in recent months, Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports fuelled by a rebound in global trade, they retracted % change y-o-y very recently as shown in the latest available monthly 0 data from November.

However, -20 these represent a strong improvement compared to the decline of more than 20% between April and July. -25 Based on the usually applied non-seasonally adjusted -30 view, exports declined by 4.2% y-o-y in November and fell by 0.2% y-o-y in October.

Retail sales growth slowed down again as well, growing by 0.7% y-o-y in November, compared to growth of 6.7% y-o-y in October. However, this strong yearly pick-up was very much influenced by last year’s large October decline after the sales tax increase in 3Q19. In line with the economy’s domestic slowdown, consumer sentiment, as reported by the Cabinet Office, was 32.1 in December, compared to 33.7 in November. Near-term expectations After the sharp rebound in 3Q20, growing by 22.9% q-o-q SAAR, growth expectations for Japan’s economy are forecast having slowed down in 4Q20 to lower growth of 4.6% q-o-q SAAR. The recovery is forecast to soften in 2021. Especially 1Q21 will again be impacted by the rise in COVID-19 cases and the consequent lockdown and social-distancing measures, particularly in Tokyo, after the government declared a “soft” state of emergency for the Tokyo area. These measures will cut growth in 1Q21 to almost zero, while a strong rebound is expected by 2Q21, leading to average quarterly growth of 0.7% q-o-q SAAR. The still relatively low number of COVID-19 infections is forecast to benefit the economy in the rebound of 2021. The availability of vaccines will also lift growth further, with Japan’s economy benefitting from the domestic and global containment of COVID-19, as well as a further recovery in global trade. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 15 World Economy December PMIs point to a gradual improvement of the Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs recovery in Japan in the manufacturing sector, while Index the domestically driven services sector is facing 60 ongoing challenges.

While GDP growth is expected to remain supported by stimulus measures, leading to a recovery in private household consumption and investments, GDP growth in 2021 is unchanged from last month to stand at 2.8%. Upside support may come from an acceleration in world trade amid a recovery in global consumption, potentially supported by successful vaccination programmes in major economies. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s GDP grew 4.9% y-o-y in 3Q20, following 3.2% y-o-y growth in 2Q20.

On the policy front, the government announced the 14th Five-Year Plan that was supposed to begin in 2021 and target slower but higher-quality growth. In line with this plan and the ongoing robust economic recovery, policymakers might support tighter fiscal policy, in particular more restrained public investment in infrastructure.

Nonetheless, the improvement in the last part of 2020 offers further upside potential and consistent improvements in economic activity such as auto sales and PMIs offer additional support. In addition, fiscal stimulus injected in October and November may materialize faster and more effectively than that of May, leading to more signs of an economic rebound.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 19 World Economy Latin America Brazil Update on latest developments GDP growth data for 3Q20 shows a less severe impact of COVID-19 on Brazil’s economy in 2020. However, since the “corona voucher” programme that has been an instrumental in supporting private savings and consumption is ending in January 2021, the recovery might slow in 1Q21. The 3Q20 recovery was primarily due to a strong rebound in domestic demand, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy, as government support policies for vulnerable households offset COVID-19 impacts on the labour market. Key indicators for 4Q20 suggest a slight slowdown in Graph 3 15: Brazil’s inflation vs. interest rate major economic sector performance amid fears of an % change y-o-y % per annum ongoing virus wave locally and globally.

Industrial production in Brazil rose 2.80% y-o-y in November compared to a 0.3% rise in October, lower than the upwardly revised 3.7% gain recorded in September. Retail trade in Brazil continued to increase on an annual basis. October retail sales rose 8.30% over the same month in the 2019, the biggest increase since February 2014. Moreover, consumer confidence jumped to 43.8 in 2Q20, from 42.8 in 3Q20, though it was less than the 47.3 recorded in 4Q19. Brazilian consumers appear to be more optimistic about their personal income and financial situation considering the generous fiscal stimulus and vaccination developments. With the global economy appearing unlikely to rebound quickly, Brazil's trade balance reversed its December 2019 surplus of $5.95 billion to a deficit of $0.04 billion in December 2020. Exports dropped 0.7% y-o-y to $18.37 billion, while imports rose by 47% y-o-y to $18.41 billion. Over the whole of 2020, Brazil’s trade surplus increased by 6% y-o-y to $53 billion. Near-term expectations Despite the high rate of urban mobility compared to the rest of the Latin America region and the scale of policy support, Brazil’s GDP growth so far is 4.1% lower than pre-pandemic levels with consumer spending 6.4% below 4Q19. The outlook for 2021 depends upon the trajectory of the pandemic and availability of COVID-19 vaccines for a sizable share of the population. Additionally, the private demand outlook and consumer confidence could continue to be affected by the weak labour market and uncertainty over the growth of public spending. Nevertheless, the positive news about vaccines along with nationwide vaccination campaigns and further recovery of mobility to pre-pandemic levels could propel growth in sectors such as travel that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Failure to tighten fiscal policy enough after COVID-19 could renew debt sustainability woes, lifting interest rates and inflation. 20 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Economy Business confidence, especially in manufacturing, Graph 3 16: Brazil’s PMIs remained strong despite a decline in the IHS Markit Index Brazil manufacturing PMI, which dropped to 61.5 in 70 December 2020 from 64 in November. , the positive 61.5 sentiment were driven by hopes that the COVID-19 60 pandemic will end and raw material availability will 50 51.1 improve disruptions to sectors are mainly driven by increased inventories levels and concerns over the 40 new wave of the virus. 30 More importantly, Brazil’s services PMI rose to 51.1 20 in December 2020 from 50.9 in the previous month, the fourth consecutive expansion in the sector.

Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments South Africa’s economy began to face a new outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2020, fuelling a rise in cases and fatalities. Nonetheless, the government did not introduce a new national lockdown given the severe economic damage caused by earlier strict containment measures, but tighter restrictions were imposed in the main hotspots. COVID-19 has worsened the already challenging economic outlook as the country has had some of the world’s strictest lockdown measures in place since the end of March 2020. Nevertheless, South Africa’s economy expanded by 66.1% q-o-q in 3Q20. All economic activities registered q-o-q growth with the largest contributions coming from manufacturing and trade. Nevertheless, the economic output in 3Q20 was 6.0% less than 3Q19 and over the three first three quarters of 2020, the South Africa’s economy declined by 7.9% y-o-y. Labour market conditions worsen as the unemployment rate surged to 30.8% in 3Q20 from 23.3% in 2Q20, the highest jobless rate since 2008. The number of job-seekers surged amid the easing of lockdown restrictions and increased by 2.2 million to 6.5 million, though employment rose by 543,000 to 14.7 million and the labour force jumped by 2.8 million to 21.2 million. Vehicle sales in South Africa dropped by 29.1% to 380,449 units in 2020, reflecting the decline in private consumption because of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. However, consumer confidence rose to -12 in 4Q20 from -23 in 3Q20 amid the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions that allowed more economic activity to resume. Even though the latest consumer confidence index was the lowest since 4Q15. The RMB/BER business confidence index jumped to 40 in 4Q20, its highest since 2Q18 and up from 24 in 3Q20 amid the easing of lockdown restrictions. Near-term expectations The outlook for South African economic growth in 2021 remains highly uncertain and could also move to the downside because of renewed risks associated with rising infections. Moreover, government commitments made to the IMF in return for rapid financing might force the government to accelerate the economic reforms. Additionally, like most countries around the globe, South Africa’s economic recovery is highly dependent on OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 21 World Economy vaccination developments and a sizable share of the country’s population might not be vaccinated until the end of 2021. However, the global expansion of vaccinations could support external demand and trade. The gloomy outlook is reflected through South Africa's Absa Manufacturing PMI. It fell to 50.3 in December 2020 from 52.6 in November 2020 amid the decline in business activity and new sales since the reintroduction of some lockdown restrictions to curb the new wave of infections.

Russia and Central Asia Russia Update on the latest developments Russia’s economy continued to show a robust recovery despite the significant slowdown in October and a major new wave of COVID-19. The latest data for 4Q20 suggested a slowdown in private consumption but a significant pickup in the industrial sector. Retail sales dropped 3.4% y-o-y in November following a contraction of 2.4% y-o-y in October, on the back of a surge in COVID-19 infections. Industrial production in Russia recorded the smallest contraction in eight month, 2.6% y-o-y in November compared to the 5.5% slump the previous month. Labour market pressure eased slightly as the unemployment rate dropped to 6.1% in November from 6.3% in October. The government continued to support businesses and private consumption hit by the COVID-19 lockdown by applying a special subsidies and tax breaks amounting to 3.4% of GDP. However, the government plans to roll back its stimulus in 2021 in order to narrow the budget deficit, which is projected to narrow to 2.4% of GDP. Inflationary pressure grew in December and remained Graph 3 17: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate above the central bank's 4% target, with the CPI rising % to 4.9% from 4.4% in November and mainly driven by 8 increased costs for both food and non-food products.

OPEC Member Countries Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s non-oil economic activity expanded at the fastest pace towards the end of 2020, driven by increased domestic demand and positive business sentiment stemming from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. The IHS Markit Saudi Arabia non-oil PMI rose to 57.0 in December 2020 from 54.7 in November, pointing to the fourth straight month of expansion in the industrial sector. To sustain the positive trend, the credit to the private sector rose 11.7% in 2020. The government, meanwhile, announced large-scale measures to secure lending through 2020, especially for those businesses hit by COVID-19 lockdown measures. The current expansion might be extended further with COVID-19 cases are under control compared to other countries in the region and a vaccination programme underway. The ongoing recovery in oil prices supported by recent DoC decisions provide further support in 2021. Nigeria Nigeria’s economy entered a recession in 3Q20 with real GDP contracting by 3.6% y-o-y after a sharp contraction of 6.1% y-o-y in 2Q20. Moreover, the inflationary pressure continued to challenge Nigeria’s economy, as the CPI rose to 14.9% y-o-y in November from 14.2% y-o-y in October. Elevated food prices and possible naira adjustments pose additional inflationary risks. Inflation rose by 1.60% m-o-m in November 2020, the highest since May 2017, following an increase of 1.54% in October 2020. On a bright note, consumer confidence increased to -14.80 points in 4Q20 from -21.20 in 3Q20. Business confidence, in contrast, decreased to -15.20 points in December from -1.50 points in November. The Moody’s rating agency noted that Nigeria’s credit rate is now B2/negative, which reflects increasing exposure to fiscal and external shocks amid the limited fiscal resources available. Otherwise, the Stanbic IBTC Bank Nigeria PMI increased to 51.8 in December 2020 from 50.9 in the previous month, indicating an overall improvement in the Nigerian non-oil private sector. Also according to the survey sentiment regarding 2021 recorded a five-month high, fuelled by business expansion plans. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 23 World Economy In the meantime, a meaningful rise in oil prices following the recent DoC decisions along with a positive trajectory from COVID-19 vaccines would brighten the 2021 outlook and lay the groundwork for a hopeful medium-term real GDP expansion. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) The recent the non-oil UAE PMI index pointed to a slight increase in the UAE of non-oil private-sector growth, with sales and exports rising. The PMI index rose to 51.2 in December from 49.5 in November, moving into positive economic sentiment territory amid the eased COVID-19-related restrictions and sustained government stimulus measures. Extensive stimulus measures have helped sustain the economy during the COVID-19 crisis. However, the recovery in 2021 is highly dependent on the oil price improvement, which is central to a strong business environment and economic recovery. The vaccine rollout provides further optimism considering that the UAE has already vaccinated 8% of its population and aims to cover half of its population in 1Q21.

The decline is marginally less than expected in last month’s MOMR. Total demand for petroleum products is now estimated to average 90.0 mb/d in 2020. Oil demand in the OECD region in 2020 was revised lower due to weaker-than-expected data in OECD Americas, particularly in 2H20. The recovery in transportation fuels was further muted due to an increase in COVID-19 cases, thereby reducing mobility in the US. In the non-OECD region, oil demand in 2020 was revised higher, mainly reflecting better-than-expected demand in China and India in 4Q20. Strong petrochemical feedstock demand as well as a healthy uptick in gasoline requirements supported the upward revision in both countries. In contrast, lower-than-expected demand from Other Asia counterbalanced some of the upside momentum elsewhere in the non-OECD region. In 2021, world oil demand is forecast to increase by 5.9 mb/d, unchanged from last month’s report, to total 95.9 mb/d. In the OECD region, oil consumption is expected to increase by 2.6 mb/d to reach total demand of 44.8 mb/d. Oil demand is not projected to fully recover from the 2020 slump. OECD Americas is projected to increase the most amid rebounding transportation fuels, mainly gasoline, as well as steady lightand middle-distillate requirements. In the non-OECD region, oil demand is estimated to rise by 3.3 mb/d to reach 51.2 mb/d. Demand growth is projected to be driven by China, followed by India and Other Asia. A solid rebound in economic activities is projected to support industrial fuel demand. Demand for petrochemical feedstock is also forecast to support demand growth in 2021.

The index showed a drop of 5.0%,y-o-y, in October, compared to a 6.3% decline in September, as per the latest Federal Reserve Board and Haver Analytics reports. Jet fuel also recorded losses of around 0.7 mb/d, y-o-y, in October, compared to a 0.8 mb/d decline in September indicating an ongoing struggle to recover in the aviation sector. With an upsurge in COVID-19 infection cases across various states, a number of airliners have also reduced their flights scheduled in the 4Q20 and 1Q21. Tourist arrivals in the US, as reported by the National Travel and Tourism Office as well as Haver Analytics, continued to decline sharply, posting a huge 88.8% y-o-y drop in October. Near-term expectations The US economy is anticipated to recover relatively well this year, supported by the availability of viable vaccines in combination with well-targeted stimulus measures, which in turn will support oil demand going forward. However, the slowdown in oil demand exhibited in the 4Q20 is anticipated to also affect 1H21’s oil demand. The recovery in transportation fuels, including gasoline, is additionally linked to developments in the labour market and gasoline retail prices. The current outlook assumes a respectable recovery in both variables. Uncertainties about the structural impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour, particularly in the aviation sector, as well as the speed of vaccination programs, are to be monitored closely going forward. However, the aviation sector is anticipated to remain below the 2019 level in 2021. Conversely, stimulus programs are estimated to support recovering economic momentum and allow for healthy growth in construction and manufacturing activities.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 27 World Oil Demand As a significant number of European countries entered into nationwide lockdowns including France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the Netherlands, jet fuel demand fell steeply and is also anticipated to be muted throughout the winter season. On-road diesel was affected by a reduction in mobility across the continent. The mobility indicator, which is based on a combination of Google and Apple location data, showed a deterioration in mobility across European countries in October. After peaking during the summer driving season at around 119 points, using February 2020 as a reference, the indicator dropped to below 81 points towards the end of October. Demand for industrial fuels continued to lag as fuel oil declined by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in October compared to a drop of 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in September. The industrial production indicator, which excludes construction, dropped by 3.0%, y-o-y, in October, compared to a y-o-y decline of 5.3% in September, according to the Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. However, this indicates a notable improvement from the historical drop recorded in April of 27.7%. On the positive side, demand for light distillates, including naphtha and LPG, edged higher, y-o-y, for the second consecutive month adding 0.2mb/d, y-o-y, in October, compared to a 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y increase in September amid healthy demand for polyolefin and plastic products.

November’s preliminary data for the big four consuming countries in Europe indicated another large decline of 1.4 mb/d, y-o-y, with demand in the UK dropping the most by 0.5 mb/d, followed by France with 0.3 mb/d, Germany 0.3 mb/d, and Italy 0.2 mb/d. Further deterioration in transportation fuel consumption caused by nationwide shutdowns across the continent is the major reason behind these declines. Near-term expectations Restriction measures have affected transportation fuels in 4Q20 and will also have a significant negative impact for the 1Q21. Some positive support may emerge from light distillate demand, which continued to surprise in a number of major consuming countries. Uncertainties remain high going forward with the main downside risks being issues related to COVID-19 containment measures and the impact of the pandemic on consumer behaviour. These will also include how many countries are adapting lockdown measures, and for how long. At the same time, quicker vaccination plans and a recovery in consumer confidence provide some upside optimism. For now, the outlook assumes that these measures will remain in place throughout the winter season and likely until inoculation has reached a respectable proportion of the population. With this in mind, 2021 projections assume a healthy recovery in economic activities including industrial production, an improving labour market and higher vehicle sales than in 2020. Accordingly, oil demand is anticipated to rise steadily this year supported primarily by transportation and industrial fuels. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments As South Korean oil demand flipped into negative territory in October, falling by 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y, compared to a small y-o-y increase in September, the overall demand in OECD Asia-Pacific region recorded a significant decline of around 0.8 mb/d, y-o-y, in October, nearly matching the declines recorded during the peak pandemic levels in 2Q20. 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Demand All petroleum products exhibited significant y-o-y Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y declines, especially jet kerosene.

Initial Japanese oil demand data for the month of November indicates a decline by 0.2 mb/d y-o-y compared to a 0.4 mb/d y-o-y decline in October, as reported by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). Demand for all product categories declined, y-o-y, with gasoline dropping the most. Despite declining y-o-y, jet kerosene showed significant developments due to winter season stocking. Near-term expectations Oil demand is estimated to have also declined, y-o-y, in the last two months of 2020 despite m-o-m improvements supported by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures and the arrival of the winter season. Regional lockdown measures in Japan and South Korea may limit oil demand going into 2021. However, oil demand in OECD Asia Pacific is projected to grow for the first time in seven years, but will remain below 2019 levels. A return of some of the consumption lost in 2020 in addition to recovering economic activities are projected to support a demand increase in 2021. Risks are currently estimated to be skewed to the downside depending on COVID-19 pandemic developments, especially in 1H21. Petrochemical feedstock demand is estimated to be a key supporter to oil demand growth amid healthy demand for plastics and improving industrial sector requirements. At the same time, increases in jet fuel demand will lag pre-pandemic levels amid limited international business and leisure travel. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 29 World Oil Demand Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments In November, a continuation of robust naphtha consumption supported demand in China, which showed a strong y-o-y increase. China’s demand rose by a solid 0.8 mb/d, y-o-y, compared to a 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, rise in October. Similar to the prior month, China’s absolute demand hovered around 13.3 mb/d in November.

Near-term expectations The continued improvement in economic activities is expected to support oil demand over the short term. The management of COVID-19 pandemic, the introduction of steady fiscal and monetary stimulus programs, and seasonal Lunar Year demand are expected to underpin demand in the coming months. All economic sectors are projected to continue to pick up with the transportation sector being supported by a recovery in road traffic and healthy passenger sales, while the industrial sector is estimated to receive support from improving economic activities in China and globally. Light distillate demand, particularly in the petrochemical sector, is anticipated to drive demand growth in the current year. Jet fuel is projected to slowly recover from the massive 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Demand disruptions seen in 2020. The oil demand projection for 2021 also assumes an increase in petroleum product requirements in 2H21 on the back of availability of COVID-19 vaccines leading to a rebound in consumer confidence and strengthening manufacturing activities. India Update on the latest developments In November, Indian oil demand reversed trend to Graph 4 5: India’s oil demand, y-o-y change post a y-o-y decline, after a healthy y-o-y increase in mb/d October. However, total consumption reached the 1 highest level recorded in 2020.

Additionally, the November PMI indicator, as reported by the IHS Markit, decreased. Indian Manufacturing PMI fell to 56.3 in November from 58.9 in October. Jet fuel continued to be a drag and showed similar declines to October, dropping by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y. Domestic air flights continued to show improvement m-o-m, however, further gains are less likely as domestic air flight capacity is projected to be limited at around 60% until February 2021. Moreover international flights are projected to be suspended at least until the end of 2020. Any likely support for jet fuel demand will stem from cargo flights which are anticipated to improve gradually going forward.

Sources: JODI, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India and OPEC. Another important development to highlight is the positive growth in gasoline requirements which increased for the third-consecutive month in November. The increase was supported by higher road traffic activities as well as higher total passenger vehicle sales. The latter increased by 4.6% y-o-y in November. Moreover, as reported by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India, sales of two-wheelers increased by 13.4% y-o-y in November, lending strong support to gasoline demand. From the labour market side, signs of improvement were recorded in November as the unemployment rate in both urban and rural areas dropped slightly to 7.1% and 6.3%, respectively, compared with 7.2% and 7.0% in October, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Near-term expectations Despite the recent y-o-y drop in demand, signs of positive developments continue to emerge especially in India’s industrial sector. Given the challenges that the Indian economy is currently facing, it remains to be seen if the economic recovery will continue. The unemployment rate and the size of stimulus measures are important OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 31 World Oil Demand factors to monitor going forward. For the last year, oil demand is foreseen declining despite improvements in 4Q20, led by industrial fuels and gasoline. This momentum is anticipated to continue into 1Q21 and a substantial recovery is projected to take place in the 2H21. However, COVID-19-related uncertainties will remain a downside risk to the oil demand recovery in the near future. The containment of the COVID-19 pandemic is projected to allow transportation fuels to rebound swiftly, as well as support healthy recovery in economic activities. The latter is a reflection of policy measures encouraging growth in private consumption and investments. Together with the baseline decline of 2020, oil demand is projected to record gains in 2021. Demand for transportation fuel will lead product demand followed by middle distillates. Latin America Update on the latest developments Despite m-o-m improvements in the consumption of transportation fuels gasoline and jet fuel, overall demand in Latin American declined further in October following a decrease in September. October data shows a drop of 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y, compared to a similar decline in September.

Elsewhere in the region, Argentina’s oil demand in October posted a decline of 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, compared to a drop of 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in September, implying a further deceleration in oil requirements, as transportation fuels continued to struggle to recover. Gasoline and jet fuel demand showed signs of weakness, declining in a similar manner to the industrial fuels including diesel and fuel oil. 32 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Demand Near-term expectations Latin American’s 2020 oil demand estimates remained as reported last month, despite rising COVID-19 infection cases in various countries in the region and worries about a strong second pandemic wave hindering the recovery in economic activities. However, major downside risks to 4Q20 oil demand estimates and 1Q21 projections remain. Consequently, transportation fuels are estimated to recover going into 2021 but face pressures, especially in Brazil and Argentina. Industrial fuel demand, including diesel and fuel oil, are projected to show improving momentum. Oil demand is estimated to record steady growth in 2021 supported by recovering economic activities and the low demand base in 2020. Demand in Brazil is projected to lead growth as the Brazilian economy has already shown signs of recovery since 2H20, supported by fiscal stimulus programs particularly targeting private consumption. Furthermore, risks remain high and tilted to the downside, depending on COVID-19 developments and vaccination plans. Unemployment and currency challenges are also important factors to monitor going forward. Brazil is projected to provide support to regional oil demand in 2021, led by a gradual rebound in transportation fuel demand. In terms of products, diesel and transportation fuels are anticipated to lead oil demand growth in the region. Middle East Update on the latest developments Demand in major oil consuming countries of the Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change Middle East fell by 0.5 mb/d, y-o-y, in October, mb/d compared to a drop of 0.6 mb/d, y-o-y, in September. 1.0 Despite increases in COVID-19 cases in a number of countries in the region, the monthly y-o-y declines 0.5 improved for the third-consecutive month.

Transportation fuels remain weak despite improvements in the momentum of the decline compared to recent months. For example, gasoline and jet fuel dropped by 0.3 mb/d, y-o-y, in September before dropping by 0.2 mb/d in October. Despite declining across most countries in the region, transportation fuels are on a recovery trajectory in line with easing lockdown measures. This is particularly the case in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and UAE. In November, oil demand in Saudi Arabia was supported by a strong y-o-y rise in fuel oil requirements. Oil demand flipped into positive territory, rising by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in November, increasing for only the second time so far in 2020, after posting a healthy rise in January prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fuel oil registered an increase of 0.3 mb/d, y-o-y, compared to an increase of 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in October, largely driven by increases in power generation demand and a rebound in industrial activities. Saudi Arabia’s non-oil PMI, as reported IHS Markit, recorded its highest readings in the past 10 months reaching 54.7 points in November. At the same time, diesel requirements remained in the negative, falling by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, despite notable increases in construction activities. Cement deliveries increased by 15.4%, y-o-y, in November, signalling a continuation of positive trend in construction activities. Transportation fuels remained largely in the negative territory as both gasoline and jet fuel dropped by roughly 0.1 mb/d each, y-o-y.

Sources: JODI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Oil demand is estimated to have improved toward the end of 2020, mainly due to successful containment measures in major consuming countries in the region. Further relaxations in restriction measures are estimated to lend further support to overall oil demand, especially for gasoline and some industrial fuels. In Saudi Arabia, effective COVID-19 vaccination programs coupled with a recovery in oil prices will provide an upside potential to oil demand in 1H21. Moreover, development in infrastructure projects and an uptick in power generation requirements should also support the expected upside momentum. Transportation fuels are estimated to continue to recover in the whole region as restriction measures ease. With the full recovery in economic activities in 2021, oil demand is anticipated to recover from the 2020 slump. At the same time, any additional measures in response to a potential second strong wave of COVID-19 will provide a downside risk to oil demand in the near term. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2020 remains unchanged from the previous month’s assessment of a y-o-y decline of 2.50 mb/d, despite a number of country-specific and regional revisions. Downward production revisions in the US, the UK and Brazil, were offset by upward revisions in countries such as Canada, other OECD Europe and Russia. Russia and the US have witnessed the largest declines in 2020, the former through its voluntary production adjustment in the DoC and the latter primarily through shut in wells in April and May 2020. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids output in 4Q20 is expected at 61.98 mb/d, up 0.69 mb/d qo-q. US drillers have added 103 oil rigs since mid-August, to reach 275 rigs in the week ending 8 January. In October, US crude oil output dropped by 0.44 mb/d m-o-m to average 10.42 mb/d, due to outages related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Non-OPEC oil supply in 2020 is forecast to decline mainly in Russia, the US, Canada, Kazakhstan and Colombia, and is projected to grow in Norway, Brazil, China, and Guyana. Non-OPEC liquids production for 2021 is also unchanged from last month and forecast to grow by 0.85 mb/d. The 2021 supply outlook is now slightly more optimistic for US shale with oil prices increasing and output is expected to recover more in 2H21. It should be noted, however, that upstream capital spending in 2021 is expected to remain well below 2019 levels, mainly due to the significantly lower investment in US shale. The US liquids supply forecast for 2021 has been revised up by 0.07 mb/d to 0.37 mb/d, although uncertainties persist. On the other hand, oil supply forecasts for the non-OPEC countries participating in DoC were revised down following the new decision taken at the recent Ministerial Meeting on 5 January. The main drivers for supply growth for 2021 are expected to be the US, Canada, Brazil, Norway, Ecuador and Qatar. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2020 is estimated to decline by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.13 mb/d. For 2021, it is forecast to grow by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.21 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in December was up by 0.28 mb/d m-o-m to average 25.36 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids output in December, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have increased by 0.30 mb/d m-o-m to average 67.57 mb/d, lower by 4.45 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply rose in December by 0.58 mb/d m-o-m to average 92.93 mb/d, down by 8.23 mb/d y-o-y.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 35 World Oil Supply Main monthly revisions Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2020 remains unchanged m-o-m, despite a number of country-specific and regional revisions. It is forecast to contract by 2.50 mb/d (including processing gains) to average 62.69 mb/d. This is higher by 0.02 mb/d in absolute terms, due to a change in the base, as the average non-OPEC 2019 supply was revised up by 0.02 mb/d and the y-o-y growth now stands at 2.08 mb/d, compared to 2018. This month’s outlook saw lower-than-expected production in 4Q20 in the US, Mexico, the UK, Thailand and Brazil, but these downward adjustments were fully offset by increases witnessed in Canada, other OECD Europe, Norway, the Sudans, Kazakhstan and Russia.

Russia’s liquids supply has been revised down by 67 tb/d due to downward revisions in 1Q21 and 2Q21 based on the new voluntary production adjustments from the recent Ministerial Meeting of DoC on 5 January 2021. The oil supply forecast for Kazakhstan and Oman in the DoC group was also revised down by a minor 8 tb/d and 6 tb/d, respectively. On the other hand, the supply forecast for the US, Canada, other OECD Europe and Australia were revised up. Key drivers of growth and decline The non-OPEC countries showing the largest liquids supply declines in 2020 are expected to be Russia, the US, Canada, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Malaysia, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil production increases are expected mainly in Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana.

Indeed, the downward revision to US oil production was offset by an upward adjustment for Canada following higher-than-expected production in 4Q20. While OECD Americas production is projected to decline by 1.08 mb/d to average 24.70 mb/d, oil supply in OECD Europe and OECD Asia Pacific is expected to grow by 0.18 mb/d to average 3.89 mb/d and by 0.01 mb/d to average 0.54 mb/d, respectively. For 2021, the OECD liquids production forecast was adjusted up by 91 tb/d on an absolute level, and by 93 tb/d in terms of growth, mainly attributed to the US. The OECD region is now forecast to increase production by 0.72 mb/d and average 29.85 mb/d. OECD Americas is expected to grow by 0.61 mb/d to average 25.31 mb/d. Oil supply in OECD Europe is anticipated to grow by 0.12 mb/d y-o-y to average 4.01 mb/d, and OECD Asia Pacific is forecast to decline by 0.01 mb/d to average 0.53 mb/d. OECD Americas US US liquids production in 2020 was revised down by Graph 5 5: US monthly liquids output by key 42 tb/d, following an upward revision in 3Q20 of component 13 tb/d and a downward adjustment in 4Q20 of mb/d 180 tb/d, due to lower-than-expected output in the 20 Lower-48 onshore fields in October. It is now forecast 16.94 18 to decline by 0.81 mb/d and average 17.61 mb/d. 16 US liquids production in October 2020 was lower by 14 0.43 mb/d m-o-m to average 16.94 mb/d, mainly due 12 to production outages of around 0.45 mb/d in the GoM following hurricanes Delta and Zeta.

US tight crude production in 2020 peaked in March at 8.23 mb/d. This was followed by a drop in April of 616 tb/d and a drastic plunge in May of 1,442 tb/d to average 6.17 mb/d. Since then, tight crude output has started to show some recovery in most key regions. In October, tight crude output dropped for the first time since May, falling by 22 tb/d to average 7.09 mb/d. This was mainly in the Eagle Ford, which averaged 0.98 mb/d, down by 28 tb/d m-o-m. The ten-month 2020 average indicates a drop of 0.30 mb/d in total US tight crude compared to the same period in 2019. 38 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Supply In other key shale regions, oil output in the Permian Graph 5 6: US tight crude output breakdown Basin increased by 32 tb/d in October to average mb/d Total 3.76 mb/d.

In terms of the major basins, 179 oil rigs were active in the Permian Basin, with four rigs added w-o-w as of 8 January, albeit still lower by 218 rigs, or 55%, y-o-y. At the same time, the number of active rigs in the Eagle Ford Basin was 26, down by 61% y-o-y. The Williston Basin reported 11 active rigs, down by 79% y-o-y, and finally 5 units were reported in the DJ-Niobrara Basin, down by 74% y-o-y. With regard to spudding, completion and started wells in all US shale plays, as reported by Rystad Energy, 356 horizontal wells were spudded in December (as per preliminary information), a drop of 663 wells in comparison with a year earlier. The preliminary number of completed wells is estimated at 523 in December, higher by 42 m-o-m, but lower by 24%, or 169 completed wells, from a year ago. At the same time, the number of started wells was up by 46 units to 600 wells due to the DUC inventories, albeit lower by around 10% or 64 wells, y-o-y. A drop of five fracked wells m-o-m in October was followed by an increase of 51 in November m-o-m, but December has seen a significant decline of 89 in the fracked wells count to 453 wells (preliminary). According to preliminary data, the number of fracked wells in December in the DJ Niobrara Basin rose m-o-m by 28 to average 105 wells. In other regions, fracking decreased m-o-m in the Permian by 102 to 237 wells, in the Eagle Ford, it was down by eight to 77 wells and it also dropped in the Bakken shale by eight to 27 wells. It is worth noting that comparing the number of fracked wells in June and November with the March 2020 level of 805 wells, sees an improvement from a 75% decline in June to a 43% decline in December. Increased fracking would likely help sustain US onshore production, as operators bring online their drilled, but uncompleted, (DUC) wells. There has been a m-o-m drop in the number of uncompleted (DUC) wells in the US shale plays since July 2020. This continued in November with a drop of a further 236 wells m-o-m to 3,591 wells. As per preliminary data, the DUC count is anticipated to have dropped by another 210 m-o-m in December to stand at 3,381 uncompleted wells.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 41 World Oil Supply Canada Canada’s liquids production in November was up Graph 5 15: Canada monthly liquids production by 0.36 mb/d m-o-m, to average 5.49 mb/d, albeit development by component down by 0.09 mb/d, y-o-y. The increase in Canadian mb/d oil output that began in September is mainly due to 2.2 maintenance ending. Synthetic crude oil production 2.0 1.89 has in fact hit an all-time high, as oil output returns to 1.8 pre-COVID levels. 1.6 1.4 1.27 1.2 1.21 The Alberta government announced on 23 October, 1.0 1.09 that it would lift production curtailments, ratified in 0.8 2018, starting from January 2021.

In November, oil producers in Alberta produced Conventional crude NGLs 3.66 mb/d, including conventional crude, and much of Synthetic crude Bitumen the increase came in the form of upgraded bitumen Sources: National Energy Board and OPEC. from oil sands, according to the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). Synthetic crude production rose to a record high of 1.27 mb/d. Bitumen output also rose to 1.89 mb/d, of which 1.73 mb/d comes from mining operations. In total, output from oil sands hit a record 3.16 mb/d in November, 12 tb/d higher than the previous record high of December 2019. Preliminary conventional crude data for November indicates higher output by 16 tb/d to average 1.21 mb/d. The data indicates an increase of 38 tb/d m-o-m in NGLs production to average 1.09 mb/d. Canada also produces 0.04 mb/d of biofuels every month. December oil production is expected to continue increasing. Canada’s oil supply in 2020 has been revised up by 41 tb/d, following upward adjustments to 3Q20 and 4Q20 of 14 tb/d and 168 tb/d, respectively. It is now estimated to contract by 0.26 mb/d, y-o-y, for an average of 5.15 mb/d. For 2021, the supply forecast was also revised up by 18 tb/d. It is now expected to see growth of 0.25 mb/d y-o-y, to average 5.40 mb/d. Mexico Mexico’s liquids output in November was flat Graph 5 16: Mexico’s monthly liquids and crude m-o-m, averaging 1.87 mb/d.

Offshore also reported that “investment in the UK and Norwegian offshore sectors should rise in 2021, according to Westwood Global Energy Group, with exploration potentially recovering to 2019 levels.” OECD Europe oil production in 2021 is forecast to increase by 0.12 mb/d to 4.01 mb/d, Norway Norwegian liquids production in November increased by 0.15 mb/d m-o-m to 2.03 mb/d. This was mainly due to an increase of 110 tb/d in crude oil production to average 1.73 mb/d, which is higher by 0.04 mb/d y-o-y, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD). The NPD said that the production figure for crude oil in November was in line with the government’s announced curtailment for 2H20 at 134 tb/d.

On 14 December, Equinor produced its first oil ahead of schedule from the Snorre Expansion project (improved oil recovery (IOR) project) in the Norwegian North Sea. This is designed to increase the recovery factor from the original 46% to 51%, to extend the life of the field through 2040 and to access close to 200 million barrels (mb) of recoverable oil. Norway has reportedly discovered resources in the amount of nearly 600 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2020. This volume assessment, which is based on the mid-point estimate provided by the NPD, makes 2020 the country’s most productive exploration year since before oil prices crashed in 2014, according to Rystad Energy. For 2021, Rystad Energy anticipates an uptick in exploration activity in Norway. Operators are again likely to concentrate exploration efforts on mature areas, making the most of available infrastructure wherever possible. Norway’s oil supply in 2020 is now expected to expand by 0.26 mb/d to average 2.00 mb/d, while in 2021 growth is forecast to slow slightly to 0.13 mb/d, y-o-y, for an average of 2.13 mb/d. This forecast also has some OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 43 World Oil Supply upside, with new projects having incremental potential, particularly if global oil demand rises more than currently anticipated. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and a slower pace of development, Equinor has delayed the Njord field redevelopment in the Norwegian Sea, with first production now expected in 2H21. The Neptune-operated Fenja project, under development as a subsea tieback to Njord, now appears likely to come onstream during 1Q22. Fenja’s main subsea and development drilling campaigns have also been deferred to 2022 The schedule for the Gjøa P1 tie-in project in the North Sea remains largely unaffected by current market conditions, but first oil from Wintershall Dea’s Duva tieback to the Neptune-operated Gjøa platform is expected to be delayed by up to six months to 3Q21, according to Offshore magazine. Further topsides work for the Duva project, which had been scheduled for the second half of 2020, will now take place in 2021 due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Elsewhere in the Norwegian North Sea, the Gudrun A-15 and Brage A12C wells should both come onstream in 1Q21, while start-up of the Gudrun A-8 well has been delayed. UK UK liquids production in November fell by 0.03 mb/d, m-o-m, returning to a level of 1.02 mb/d, owing to a minor drop of 5 tb/d in crude oil output to average 855 tb/d and a decline of 21 tb/d in NGLs production to average 96 tb/d.

It is now expected to decline by 0.08 mb/d, to average 1.07 mb/d. In 2021, first oil from the Seagull project will likely be deferred by up to 15 months to late 2022, due to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and logistics. Nevertheless, BP is due to start its ETAP topsides strengthening and installation programme in the same sector in early 2021. As a result, a contraction of 0.02 mb/d is anticipated for UK supply for 2021 to average 1.04 mb/d. Non-OECD Non-OECD liquids production for 2020 was revised down by 8 tb/d, m-o-m, to show a decline of 1.43 mb/d y-o-y and average 31.49 mb/d, mainly due to downward revisions in Latin America. China’s liquids supply is expected to grow by 0.09 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 4.15 mb/d. The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and the consequent lower demand continued to dampen India’s crude oil production in 2020, with output shrinking sharply by 0.05 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 0.78 mb/d. Oil production in Other Asia is projected to decline by 0.17 mb/d to average 2.54 mb/d. Meanwhile, Latin America is expected to grow by only 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, with growth in Brazil and Guyana offset by heavy declines in Colombia by 0.10 mb/d and in Ecuador by 0.05 mb/d, mainly due to the shutting of wells in costly oil fields, to average 6.07 mb/d. Oil production in the Middle East is projected to decline by 0.04 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 3.17 mb/d and Africa is also expected to decline by 0.07 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 1.46 mb/d. Oil production in Eurasia is expected to decline by 1.19 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 13.33 mb/d. Meanwhile, production in Russia was adjusted upwards, following an upward revision in 4Q20 of 131 tb/d. 44 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Supply For 2021, liquids production in non-OECD countries was revised down by 101 tb/d and is now forecast to decline by 0.01 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 31.48 mb/d. China is forecast to remain broadly unchanged to average 4.16 mb/d and at the same time India is projected to decline by 0.02 mb/d next year, to average 0.75 mb/d. Oil supply is projected to decline in Other Asia by a minor 0.03 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 2.50 mb/d. The first well in the Apsara offshore oil field in Cambodia is expected to come on stream with output expected to ramp up to 7,500 b/d as remaining development wells are completed. Latin America remains the key driver in the non-OECD with a y-o-y growth forecast of 0.29 mb/d, to average 6.36 mb/d. Production in Africa is forecast to decline by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y, to average 1.38 mb/d, while oil production in the Middle East is forecast to grow by 0.06 mb/d y-o-y, due to anticipated higher NGLs production in Oman and Qatar, to average 3.23 mb/d. Oil production in Eurasia is projected to show a decline of 0.23 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 13.10 mb/d.

Additionally, unlike the strong capex increases seen in the past two years, lower spending on oil sector E&P compared with higher capex allocated to boosting natural gas production, is expected to lead to oil production remaining broadly flat next year to average 4.16 mb/d, compared to the remarkable growth of 0.09 mb/d y-o-y in 2020, to average 4.15 mb/d. Latin America Latin America’s total liquids supply in November fell by 0.07 mb/d m-o-m, to average 5.90 mb/d, down by 0.51 mb/d y-o-y. Liquids production in 2020 is estimated to expand in Brazil by 0.15 mb/d, to average 3.69 mb/d, and in Guyana by 0.07 mb/d, to average 0.07 mb/d. Meanwhile, oil production in other countries in the region is estimated to decline. Latin America’s oil supply in 4Q20 fell by 0.20 mb/d q-o-q to average 5.94 mb/d. Latin America’s oil supply for 2020 is now estimated to inch up by only 0.01 mb/d y-o-y, to average 6.07 mb/d. This is mainly due to lower-than-expected oil output in all countries of the region following the shut in of wells on the back of COVID-19 and a slowdown in drilling and operations, as well as the prolonged maintenance in Brazil. For 2021, oil production is projected to grow by 0.29 mb/d y-o-y, to average 6.36 mb/d. Oil production in Brazil, Guyana and Peru is forecast to increase, owing to production ramp-ups in fields that started in 2019 and 2020. Production in Ecuador is projected to recover by 0.06 mb/d from outages seen in 2020, to average 0.55 mb/d. Oil production is likely to remain flat in other countries of the region. Brazil Brazil’s crude oil production in November was down by 119 tb/d m-o-m to average 2.76 mb/d, a drop of 335 tb/d y-o-y, mainly due to planned field maintenance in the Tupi and Buzios oil fields. Crude output hit 3.09 mb/d in August 2020, but began to decline in September and subsequent months and probably continued into December. This was not only because of maintenance, but also due to COVID-19-related safety measures OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 45 World Oil Supply leading to the postponement of scheduled work from 4Q20 to the beginning of 2021, according to Petrobras. NGLs production increased m-o-m in November by 18 tb/d and returned to the August level of 104 tb/d. According to national data, biofuels production was pegged at 645 tb/d in October and preliminary data shows that it remained flat in November and December. In November, Brazil liquids production, including biofuels, declined by 0.11 mb/d, m-o-m, to average 3.50 mb/d.

For 2021, incremental production is anticipated to come from several project ramp ups such as the Berbigao/Sururu and Atapu fields, each having a peak capacity of 150 tb/d, which started up in 4Q19 and 2Q20, respectively. On top of that, Petrobras will start to produce oil from two large projects – Sepia and Mero I – each having 180 tb/d peak capacity, and both scheduled to start in 2H21. The Mero offshore field is said to be Brazil’s third largest pre-salt discovery and has been undergoing test production since 2017. According to Total, one of the partners of Petrobras in the project, the Mero 1 FPSO is due to start operating in 2021 and Mero 2 in 2023. Liquids supply in 2021 is forecast to grow by 0.17 mb/d to average 3.86 mb/d, mainly due to crude oil from pre-salt areas. Eurasia The oil supply forecast for Eurasia (formerly FSU + other Europe) for 2020 was revised up by 35 tb/d from last month’s assessment to show a lesser contraction of 1.19 mb/d and an average of 13.33 mb/d. Production in the three countries participating in the DoC – Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan– is forecast to drop by 1.02 mb/d, 0.11 mb/d and 0.06 mb/d, respectively in 2020. For 2021, oil production in the region is forecast to decline by 0.23 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 13.10 mb/d, of which Russia is forecast to drop by 0.21 mb/d, while production in both Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan is projected to be flat. Other Eurasia is projected to decline by 0.02 mb/d. Russia Preliminary data for Russia’s liquids production in December shows an increase of 0.04 mb/d m-o-m for an average of 10.18 mb/d. This is lower by 1.29 mb/d y-o-y. Crude oil production in December averaged 9.28 mb/d, an increase of 0.04 mb/d m-o-m. Russia’s condensate output was pegged at 898 tb/d in November (y-t-d average of 838 tb/d). Gazprom has been the big condensate producer in Russia, producing 373 tb/d, y-t-d. It is estimated that NGLs output in December will be at the same level as November. Annual liquids production in 2020 was revised up by 0.03 mb/d and is now forecast to decrease by 1.02 mb/d y-o-y, to average 10.42 mb/d. For 2021, Russian producers will face the challenge of higher taxes following reforms approved this year, labelled as the biggest in the country since 2002. Hence, Russian liquids supply, mainly due to the crude oil production adjustments for 2021, was revised down by 67 tb/d and is forecast to drop by 0.21 mb/d, y-o-y, to average 10.21 mb/d. 46 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 World Oil Supply Graph 5 26: Russia's monthly liquids production Graph 5 27: Russia’s quarterly liquids output and forecast mb/d Dec 19 mb/d 11.47 12 12 Jun 21-Dec 21 11 10.30 10.14 11 10 9.99 9 10 8 9 Dec 19 Feb 20 Apr 20 Jun 20 Aug 20 Oct 20 Dec 20 Feb 21 Apr 21 Jun 21 Aug 21 Oct 21 Dec 21 8 Liquids production Crude oil output Crude required: 2021 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20* 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* Sources: Nefte Compass, The Ministry of Energy of the Note: * 4Q20-4Q21 = Forecast.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 49 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Product Markets and Refinery Operations Global refining margins showed mixed results in December. In the US, the sole positive performing region, margins were supported by strength from all but the bottom section of the barrel. Improvement in transport activity during year-end holidays, amid supressed refinery intakes that remain around 2 mb/d below y-o-y levels, backed the product markets. In Europe, margins weakened – affected by stronger crude prices amid the seasonal weakness – with solid losses at the top and bottom sections of the barrel. In Asia, refining margins suffered mostly in the bottom section of the barrel due to a decline in fuel oil requirements from the utilities sector. The surge in crude prices weighed further on Asian refining economics. Refineries have returned from the autumn peak maintenance season, which contributed to a slight rise in available spare capacity globally, and await the right incentives to be utilized. Refinery margins US refinery margins rose for the fourth consecutive Graph 6 1: Refining margins month, with solid gains backed by moderate US$/b US$/b improvement in personal transportation fuel 15 15 consumption. This led to lower inventory levels, which in turn helped support fuel prices and crack spreads 10 10 with the exception of fuel oil. 5 5 The end of peak refinery maintenance season in December and the subsequent drop in offline 0 0 capacity, led to stronger refinery intakes during the -5 -5 month. This most likely placed a cap on the refining Dec 19 Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 economics upside, although they remained considerably lower, by around 2 mb/d compared to the levels of a year earlier. US refinery margins for WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) WTI averaged $8.10/b in December, up by $1.25/b Oman (Singapore) m-o-m but down by $5.31 y-o-y. Sources: Argus and OPEC. Refinery margins in Europe continued to suffer compared to the other main regions, and came under pressure as weakness in the gasoline segment offset the strength that came from the middle and bottom sections of the barrel. The already slow demand recovery from the pandemic-induced slump in European fuel markets was exacerbated by the third round of hard lockdowns implemented in mid-December in some European countries due to rising COVID-19 infections. Moreover, the return of refineries from the maintenance season resulted in a rise in product output and a more pronounced product surplus in the region. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged 52¢/b in December, down by 54¢ compared to a month earlier and down by $1.90 y-o-y. Asian product markets weakened, pressured by stronger crude prices that rose significantly in December. A downturn in fuel oil markets as high sulphur fuel oil consumers for the utilities sector resorted to LNG as an alternative feedstock. Despite the positive performance in all other key products, supported from stronger domestic gasoil consumption and an improvement in air transportation, it was insufficient to lift regional refining margins. In December, the Chinese government issued the first batch of refined fuel export quotas for 2021 to six state-controlled entities and to private refiner Rongsheng. Overall volume rose to 29.5 million tonnes, an increase of 5.4% from the first batch in 2020. Given the pandemic-induced contraction in product markets, China’s growing refining sector may exert even more pressure on its competitors in Asia and the Middle East, leaving little upside potential for margins until further consolidation occurs. Strong refinery runs in China, rapidly rising product inventory levels and renewed COVID-19-related lockdowns point to further pressure on Asian product markets going forward. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia lost 19<U+023C> m-o-m to average 84¢/b in December, which was higher by $2.06 y-o-y. 50 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased in December to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 79.14%, which corresponds to a throughput % % of 14.55 mb/d.

The US gasoline crack spreads gained $2.41 m-o-m to average $11.23 in December, down by $3.34/b y-o-y. The USGC jet/kerosene strengthened, exhibiting the strongest positive performance relative to other regions, backed by improvement in consumption from the aviation sector. However, prevailing restrictions in international air travel, strict quarantine regulations in many countries, and changing customer habits towards air travel, such as preference for non-stop flights instead of connecting routes, continue to weigh on jet fuel markets. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $9.00/b, up by $2.48 m-o-m but down by $11.08 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI gained some solid ground supported by strong inventory drawdowns amid relatively lower refinery outputs. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $7.14/b, up by $2.63 m-o-m but down by $8.40 y-o-y. US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI showed a trend reversal and weakened, as they reached a five-month low following a two-month upward trend in response to a build in inventory levels.

Jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent rose over the month, with supplies coming under added pressure as production rates for the product declined further in the region. Positive support came from the aviation sector amid signs of demand recovery as a large number of operators increased their flight capacity during the month. Jet fuel floating storage in Europe accounted for 34% of total offshore inventories in December against 67% in November, according to secondary sources. Although European onshore stocks remain elevated, ARA jet floating storage eased to below 1 mb in early December, triggering signs of increased tightness, which contributed to the positive performance. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $4.51/b, up by 99¢ m-o-m but down by $8.83 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads moved upwards, supported by slower diesel arrivals from the East, which contributed to downward pressure on diesel floating inventory levels. At the same time, the re-implementation of lockdown measures in light of a surge in COVID-19 infections across Europe led to deeper contango in ICE gasoil time spreads. On one hand the colder weather exacerbated the pressure on personal mobility, while on the other it contributed to a boost in heating demand. During the first half of the month, mobility indicators showed signs of a fast recovery as most countries eased COVID-19 restrictions for the Christmas holidays. Cracks retained much of their strength, with refiners appearing hesitant to switch yields away from light distillates towards middle distillates. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $5.46/b, which was higher by 56¢ m-o-m but lower by $8.00 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% cracks spreads suffered considerable loss, affected by weaker demand despite lower production levels for the same product in the region. HSFO demand from South Asia rebounded after LNG prices soared in December, while the HSFO balance in Asia signalled tightness. Meanwhile, the shortage of LNG in Asia unsettled the balance of the product in the region amid strong heating demand, leading to a surge in LNG prices. More importantly, as gas-fired plants in Japan reduced operational rates amid low inventories, fuel oil markets could receive more support, especially as coal-fired plants are reportedly running at high rates as well. Higher Kuwaiti demand for HSFO is also supporting markets in the east of Suez. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus-$6.09/b in December, having lost $3.44 m-o-m, but gained $28.67 y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92 crack spread gained some ground, possibly affected by positive sentiment based on expectations of a pick-up in interregional exports ahead of the holiday season. However, Asian mobility indicators showed significant intraregional discrepancy, according to secondary sources, as OECD Asia gasoline markets came under pressure from a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, with both Japan and South Korea reporting record-high daily infection rates. Indian data reveals November gasoline sales at some 790 tb/d, the highest monthly volumes on record. Gasoline inventories in Japan were reported to have been trending upwards while Singapore stocks grew as well. Simultaneously, Chinese refiners are keeping gasoline export levels high, with all signs pointing to further weakness in the near term. The Singapore gasoline crack spread against Oman in December averaged minus-$2.62/b, up by 44¢ m-o-m but down by $3.86 y-o-y. 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Singapore light distillate naphtha crack spreads Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai rebounded as a surge in LNG prices in China shifted US$/b US$/b the petrochemical feedstock choice to naphtha.

In the middle of the barrel, the jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia climbed to their highest level since March 2020, supported by a slight uptick in aviation demand and expectations for firmer winter heating demand for kerosene. The jet fuel cracks have nearly doubled over the last month as demand for kerosene picked up ahead of peak winter in Japan and South Korea. Jet fuel and kerosene belong to the same grade of oil products, with jet margins determining the profitability of both. Scheduled flights operating globally were 46% lower in November y-o-y, but showed moderate y-o-y improvement relative to the previous month, according to external sources. The Asian aviation fuel market also got some support from air cargo demand, which was firm towards the end of the month, driven by a surge in online shopping and package deliveries for the holiday season. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $4.09/b, up by $1.78 m-o-m but was down by $8.80 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, supported by the continuous expansion of manufacturing activities as evidenced by an improvement in China’s PMI in the previous month. Strong demand, particularly from China and India, for consumer goods prior to the end-ofthe-year holiday season provided further support. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $4.72/b, up by 90 ¢/b m-o-m but down by $9.30 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil crack spreads – the sole negative performer across the barrel – suffered losses, pressured by stronger LNG competition as an alternative feedstock for the utilities sector. In China, LNG imports jumped, supported by delays at the Panama Canal as well as China’s ban on Australian coal. This led to lower HSFO consumption and kept prices for the product under pressure, despite healthy requirements from the bunker sector. In addition, a decline in import requirements from Pakistan and Bangladesh in midDecember as crude prices surged, contributed to the negative performance. Fuel oil imports into Asia in midDecember were reported to have dropped by more than 50% over the first half of the month. On the other hand, continued weakness going forward could unlock more fuel oil buying interest and improve HSFO coker margins. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus-$3.70/b, down by $3.09 m-o-m but up by $19.96 y-o-y.

VLCC and Suezmax rates saw some improvement on eastward rates from the Middle East and West Africa, as well as from West Africa to the US Gulf Coast. Aframax rates edged lower, weighed down by a sluggish intra-Med performance. Clean tanker rates continued to see a pick up from multi-year lows seen at the start of the 4Q20, with gains both East and West of Suez. As with the oil market and the global economy as a whole, 2020 was a volatile one for the tanker market. However, in contrast to the oil market, March and April were ‘golden’ rather than ‘black’ months as tanker freight rates soared to record highs in all major shipping regions. Dislocations caused by the COVID-19 crisis resulted in an excess of crude in the market as consumption collapsed, overwhelming onshore inventories and leading to a surge in floating storage demand for both crude and products, all of which supported tanker rates across the globe. By June, spot freight rates had fallen back to lower levels, where they remained for the rest of 2020. While ongoing efforts to address the imbalance in the oil market by OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries in the DoC may reduce tonnage demand in the near term, the tanker market will benefit as the reduced overhang stabilizes oil trade trends, and as easing lockdown measures and a rollout of the COVID19 vaccine supports a return of economic activity. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in December, after increasing the month before, falling 1.2 mb/d, or 7.2%, to average just under 15.1 mb/d. The decline occurred across all major routes. Spot fixtures were 3.2 mb/d, or more than 17%, lower than the same month last year, reflecting the overall muted environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

OPEC spot fixtures averaged 9.7 mb/d in December, representing a decline of almost 8% m-o-m, or 0.8 mb/d. Compared to the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were around 21% lower, or almost 2.7 mb/d, reflecting in part the production adjustments from OPEC countries. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East averaged 5.7 mb/d in December, representing a decline of more than 0.7 mb/d, or around 11%, m-o-m. Y-o-y, this represents a decline of 1.0 mb/d or almost 16%. Middle East-to-West fixtures continued to lead the m-o-m losses, falling 13%, or 0.1 mb/d, in December to average 0.8 mb/d. This was still 0.7 mb/d, or 47%, lower compared with the same month last year. Outside of the Middle East, fixtures were broadly flat, down less than 1% m-o-m, to average just under 3.3 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures declined more than 22% or just under 1.0 mb/d. Sailings and arrivals OPEC sailings increased 1.4% in December, or 0.29 mb/d, to average 20.76 mb/d, compared with a yearhigh of 25.5 mb/d in April. The increase came as more Libyan barrels became available in the market. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings were 4.1 mb/d, or 16%, lower. Middle East sailings averaged 14.4 mb/d, representing a decline of around 0.3 mb/d m-o-m, or almost 2%. This was down almost 3.1 mb/d, or 18%, compared to the same month last year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 57 Tanker Market Crude arrivals declined m-o-m in December across all regions except West Asia. Arrivals in Europe led the losses, averaging 10.0 mb/d, representing a drop of almost 3%, or 0.3 mb/d, over the previous month, but were still 1.7 mb/d, or close to 15%, lower y-o-y. Far East arrivals declined by close to 3% m-o-m, or 0.3 mb/d, to average 10.8 mb/d, although this represented a y-o-y increase of 28% or 2.4 mb/d. North American arrivals also fell around 3% m-o-m, or 0.2 mb/d to average 7.4 mb/d. They also saw the largest y-o-y loss of 19% or 1.7 mb/d. In contrast, arrivals in West Asia provided a bright spot, increasing 13% m-o-m, or 0.7 mb/d, to average 6.1 mb/d.

US crude exports ended the year just below 3 mb/d in December, down from a record high of 3.7 mb/d in February 2020. In annual terms, US crude exports averaged 3.1 mb/d in 2020, a gain of 0.2 mb/d over the previous year. The latest data shows Japan’s crude imports recovered for the second month in a row to average 2.3 mb/d in November, reflecting increased seasonal demand. This is, however, still sharply lower by 22% y-o-y. China’s crude imports averaged 11.1 mb/d in November, recovering from a decline the month before as a backlog of inflows continued to clear. Preliminary data shows crude imports falling to around 9.1 mb/d in December; but inflows are expected to pick up in January when the new import quotas for independent refiners kick in. Product imports recovered in November from a weak performance in the previous month, averaging 1.3 mb/d, while product exports fell back from relatively high levels seen the previous month to average just below 1.3 mb/d. India’s crude imports jumped 24% m-o-m to an eight-month high, averaging 4.5 mb/d in November, as an easing in lockdown measures led refineries to boost runs. Both product imports and exports increased in November to average 1.0 mb/d each. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports finished 2020 near multi-decade lows, averaging 5.6 mb/d in December. Imports were up 0.2 mb/d from November. In annual terms, US crude inflows averaged 5.9 mb/d, some 0.9 mb/d below the previous year and the lowest figure since 1991. Including preliminary data for November and December, the top supplier for US crude imports was Canada, which averaged 3.6 mb/d in 2020, down from 3.8 mb/d the year before, followed by Mexico with inflows averaging 644 tb/d, up from 600 tb/d in 2019. Saudi Arabia came third, averaging 510 tb/d, compared with 500 tb/d the year before. US crude exports edged up in December to finish the year just below 3 mb/d. This was some 2% higher than in the previous month but almost 18% below the level seen in the same month of the previous year, when steadily rising pipeline capacity facilitated a then-record high in US crude exports. In yearly terms, US crude exports averaged 3.1 mb/d in 2020, a gain of 0.2 mb/d over the previous year. The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination shows continued strong buying by China in October, averaging 0.7 mb/d. US flows to China have been exceptionally strong since May 2020, when they spiked from 0.1 mb/d to a record high of 1.3 mb/d. Canada came in second with 0.54 mb/d, followed by India with 0.3 mb/d.

Compared with the same month the previous year, US product imports were 0.3 mb/d, or around 11%, lower. In annual terms, US product imports averaged just under 2.0 mb/d in 2020, representing a decline of around 0.4 mb/d y-o-y. US product exports averaged 5.3 mb/d in December, representing a m-o-m increase of about 0.4 mb/d, or about 9%. Product exports were 0.5 mb/d, or 8%, lower than the same month the previous year. In annual terms, US product exports declined 0.2 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.3 mb/d in 2020. As a result, US net product exports averaged 3.3 mb/d in December, compared with 2.9 mb/d in November 2020 and just under 3.5 mb/d in December 2019. Preliminary data indicates that the US remained a net crude and product exporter in the second half of the year with net outflows of 0.6 mb/d in December. Indeed, in the 15 months since October 2019, the US has been a net liquids exporter for all but two months.

Imports were more than 1.0 mb/d higher than the month before and broadly in line with year-ago levels. The recovery came as activities picked up from October levels which were lower due to the Golden Week holiday in early October. However, crude imports are expected to decline in December before recovering in January when the new import quotas for independent refiners kick in. Saudi Arabia reclaimed the title of top crude supplier to China in November, with a share of almost 19%, representing almost 2.1 mb/d in imports. Russia came in second with around 1.5 mb/d, representing a 14% share, followed by Oman and Iraq with 1.2 mb/d each. US arrivals more than doubled m-o-m to average 0.8 mb/d in November.

LPG imports remained steady, while fuel oil was the main driver behind the gains. Compared with the previous month, product inflows were slightly lower. In contrast, product exports declined m-o-m, falling 0.2 mb/d to average 1.3 mb/d in November, representing a drop of 0.6 mb/d compared with the same month the previous year. The increase in the m-o-m decline was driven mainly by gasoline and to a lesser extent gasoil. As a result, China returned to being a net product importer in November, though at negligible levels. This compares with net exports of 0.3 mb/d the month before and net imports of 0.5 mb/d in November 2019. 62 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – January 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Table 8 2: China’s crude and product net imports, tb/d Change China Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Nov 20/Oct 20 Crude oil 11,751 10,033 10,990 957 Total products 226 -323 25 348 Total crude and products 11,977 9,710 11,014 1,304 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding.
