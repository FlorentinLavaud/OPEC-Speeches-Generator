Moreover, worries about natural gas and coal shortages in Europe and Asia boosted sentiment for higher oil demand. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) value rose by $3.55 or 5.0% m-o-m in September to settle at $73.88/b. Year-to-date (y-t-d), the ORB was up by $26.21, or 64.5%, to average $66.83/b compared with the same period last year. The ICE Brent front-month rose $4.37, or 6.2%, m-o-m in September to average $74.88/b, while NYMEX WTI increased by $3.83, or 5.7%, m-o-m to average $71.54/b. Consequently, the Brent/WTI spread widened further in September to $3.34/b, its highest point since last April. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks – Brent, WTI and Dubai – remained in backwardation. However, the Brent forward curve strengthened, while WTI and Dubai backwardation flattened slightly. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted bullish wagers in September as oil prices rose to multi-year highs, as the risk of a natural gas and coal shortage urged speculators to bet on higher oil prices. World Economy Global economic growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 remain unchanged from the last month’s assessment at 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively. Given somewhat slowing 3Q21 momentum, the US economy forecast for 2021 is revised down slightly to 5.8% from 6.1%, while the forecast for 2022 remains unchanged at 4.1%. Euro-zone economic growth is revised up to 5% from 4.7% for 2021 and to 3.9% from 3.8% for 2022, after a strong rebound in 2Q21. The forecast for Japan is revised down to 2.6% from 2.8% for 2021, due to ongoing COVID-19-related social-distancing measures in 3Q21, while the forecast for 2022 remains at 2%. After a strong recovery in the first half of the year, China’s economy is seen to slow somewhat, leaving the growth forecast at 8.3% in 2021 and 5.8% in 2022, representing a 0.2 percentage point downward revision for both years. Meanwhile, India’s 2021 growth forecast is unchanged at 9% for 2021 and 6.8% for 2022, although downside risks prevail. Russia’s forecasts are revised up from 3.5% to 4% for 2021 and from 2.5% to 2.7% for 2022, benefitting from the more stable oil market. Brazil’s growth forecast remains unchanged for both 2021 and 2022 at 4.7% and 2.5%, respectively. The ongoing robust growth in the world economy continues to be challenged by uncertainties, such as the spread of COVID-19 variants and the pace of vaccine rollouts worldwide, as well as ongoing global supply-chain disruptions. Additionally, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with rising inflationary pressures and potential central bank responses, remain key factors requiring close monitoring. World Oil Demand World oil demand is estimated to increase by 5.8 mb/d in 2021, revised down from 5.96 mb/d in the previous month’s assessment. The downward revision is mainly driven by lower-than-expected actual data for the first three quarters of this year, despite healthy oil demand assumptions going into the final quarter of the year, which will be supported by seasonal uptick in petrochemical and heating fuel demand and the potential switch from natural gas to petroleum products due to high gas prices. Both OECD and non-OECD figures are adjusted lower, with the downward revision in OECD regions focused in 1H21, while the non-OECD revision is concentrated in 3Q21.The world is expected to consume 96.6 mb/d of petroleum products this year. For 2022, world oil demand growth is unchanged at 4.2 mb/d. As a result, global demand next year is seen averaging 100.8 mb/d. Demand is anticipated to be supported by healthy economic momentum in the main consuming countries and better management of the COVID-19 pandemic. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 is revised down by 0.3 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to now stand at 0.7 mb/d. The revisions were driven mainly by a downward adjustment in 3Q21 due to factors such as production outages in the US Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ida; maintenance in the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan; and a force majeure in Canada at the Suncor oil sands site. The impact of the Hurricane led to a downward revision in US liquids supply in 2021 from growth of 0.1 mb/d to a contraction of 0.1 mb/d. The main growth drivers for 2021 supply growth continue to be Canada, Russia, China, Norway and Brazil. Similarly, the non-OPEC supply growth forecast for 2022 is revised up by 0.1 mb/d due to the base change to OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights now stand at 3.0 mb/d. Russia and the US are expected to be the main drivers, followed by Brazil, Norway, Canada, Kazakhstan, Guyana, and other countries in the DoC. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d in both 2021 and 2022 to average 5.2 mb/d and 5.3 mb/d, respectively. OPEC crude oil production in September increased by 0.49 mb/d m-o-m, to average 27.33 mb/d, according to available secondary sources. Product Markets and Refining Operations Refinery margins further extended their upward trend in September globally, with solid support coming from the middle of the barrel. The tightness in product balance caused by supply side constraints in previous months was exacerbated by the start of peak refinery maintenance season amid lower product exports from China. Middle distillates were the main margin driver in all regions, while in Asia this upside was outpaced by robust fuel oil performance. Meanwhile, gasoline markets weakened as their crack spreads stepped down from postpandemic highs registered the previous month, due to a less optimistic demand outlook as peak driving season approached its end. Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates remained soft in September amid a continued imbalance between tonnage supply and demand, keeping rates at low or even loss-making levels. Meanwhile, some positive signs are emerging for the final quarter of the year, as loading schedules should see a 20% increase in waterborne Russian exports and 10% increase in North Sea flows, amid ongoing planned upward adjustments in OPEC production. However, a sustained recovery in the tanker market could take as long as 12 months to materialize to allow for a return in demand from emerging and developing markets and sufficient scrapping to reduce the overhang in tonnage availability. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports in September recovering from a slight dip the month before to average a healthy 6.4 mb/d, while US crude exports averaged 2.6 mb/d in September, continuing an alternating pattern of rises and dips, this time on the lower side. After four months of relatively muted levels, China’s crude imports jumped to 10.5 mb/d in August, pushed higher by the arrival of storm-delayed cargoes, although policyled uncertainties continued to impact China’s trade flows. India’s crude imports finally saw a recovery, after following a general downward trend since December 2020, to average 4.1 mb/d in August. Tanker tracking data show India’s crude imports remaining steady in September. Japan’s crude imports continued to recover from low levels, reaching their highest point since April 2020 at 2.7 mb/d in August. The country’s crude and product imports are expected to see a boost from demand in the power sector for fuel oil as well as crude for direct burning, amid reports of a restart of oil-fired power units. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary August 2021 data showed that total OECD commercial oil stocks fell by 19.5 mb m-o-m to stand at 2,855 mb. This was 363 mb lower than the same time one year ago, 183 less than the latest five-year average and 131 mb below the 2015-2019 average. Within components, OECD commercial crude stocks fell by 23.0 mb m-o-m in August, ending the month at 1,362 mb. This was down by 102 mb compared with the latest five-year average, and 87 mb below the 2015-2019 average. By contrast, OECD total product inventories rose by 3.2 mb m-o-m in August to stand at 1,493 mb. This was 81 mb lower than the latest five-year average and 43 mb below the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks fell by 0.1 days m-o-m in August to stand at 62.5 days. This was 12.3 days lower than the same period in 2020, 2.5 days below the latest five-year average and 0.3 days below the 2015-2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 is revised up by 0.1 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 27.8 mb/d, around 5.0 mb/d higher than in 2020. Demand for OPEC crude in 2022 was also revised up by 0.1 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 28.8 mb/d, around 1.0 mb/d higher than in 2021. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Winter oil market outlook Following the outbreak of COVID-19 and resulted Graph 1: Refinery intake by region lockdown measures in 2020, refined oil product mb/d mb/d consumption, along with refinery intakes, recovered 85 10 considerably in 2021.

Source: OPEC. Refinery utilization rates in 2021 have been firmly supported by stronger product fundamentals with robust gasoline performance, mainly in the US and Europe, leading to strong conversion margins in recent months and, ultimately, solid improvement in refining economics (Graph 2). The recovery in transportation fuels, as well as in the Graph 2: Refinery margins naphtha segment, was mostly driven by stronger US$/b consumption levels and robust economic activity amid 20 improved mobility indicators.

Refinery offline capacity began its seasonal rise in September, up by 891 tb/d m-o-m, according to preliminary estimates. Based on historical data and announced maintenance plans, the rise in offline capacity is projected to peak at around 9.3 mb/d in October, compared with 6.1 mb/d seen in August, before the onset of maintenance. At the same time, the renewed spread of COVID variants continues to pose a downside risk to product markets, despite the positive vaccination rollout progress, particularly with regard to air travel and jet fuel markets, the hardest pandemic-hit product segment, which has yet to fully recover. Recently, soaring natural gas prices, which have reached record-high levels, particularly in Europe during September, have triggered a growing interest in switching from natural gas to liquid fuels at the industrial level, as energy companies attempt to drive down cost. Should this trend continue, fuels such as fuel oil, diesel, and naphtha could see support, driven by higher demand from power generation, refining and petrochemical use. On the other hand, record high natural gas prices have pushed electricity costs and, consequently, refining operational costs higher. This could weigh on refinery intakes and industrial production and partially offset the upside potential. Forecasts for a colder-than-average winter in 4Q21 could set the stage for positive support for heating oil markets, particularly in December, but this could be offset by seasonal weakness from other key products across the barrel, particularly gasoline. Looking ahead, despite expectations of a seasonal pick-up in heating oil demand, as well as a potential switch from natural gas to liquid fuels, product markets are expected to see some weakness during the coming winter due to higher refinery throughput leading to ample supply. Although refineries are expected to increase run rates in line with seasonal trends to replenish stocks, any considerable growth in global intake levels could pose a challenge to product markets. Meanwhile, concerns of potential renewed COVID-19-related mobility restrictions during the winter could weigh on product markets and, consequently, refinery intakes. Thus, as oil markets continue to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation continue to maintain a vigilant watch over market fundamentals in an ongoing effort to support balance in oil market.

Signs of a recovery in oil demand in Asia due to the improving COVID-19 situation, and supply disruptions in several regions because of planned and unplanned outages, including in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) after Hurricane Ida, supported higher oil prices. The ORB value rose firmly in September. It increased by $3.55 m-o-m, or 5.0%, to stand at $73.88/b. This was on the back of higher ORB component-related crude benchmarks, and an increase in official selling prices (OSPs) for grades delivering to Asia and US markets, amid a healthier physical crude market. Crude oil futures prices bounced back in September ending the month substantially higher compared with August. ICE Brent was up 6.2% m-o-m, mirroring investors’ perception of robust global oil market fundamentals this winter. Moreover, worries about the risk of natural gas and coal shortages in Europe and Asia boosted sentiment for an additional increase in oil demand as a substitution fuel. The ICE Brent front-month rose m-o-m by $4.37, or 6.2%, in September to average $74.88/b, and NYMEX WTI increased m-o-m by $3.83, or 5.7%, to average $71.54/b. ICE Brent was $25.44 higher y-t-d, or 59.8%, at $67.97/b, while NYMEX WTI was $26.83 higher y-t-d, or 70.2%, at $65.04/b. DME Oman crude oil futures rose m-o-m in September by $3.68, or 5.3%, to settle at $72.99/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $24.20, or 57.2%, at $66.52/b. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their futures and options net long positions in September to their highest since last July. This was as oil prices rose to multi-year highs and as soaring energy prices for natural gas, coal and electricity in Europe and Asia, likely urged speculators to bet on higher oil prices. Longer than expected disruptions in US GoM production also prompted speculators to raise their bullish positions. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in sustained backwardation in September. This was on the back of expected stronger global oil market fundamentals in 4Q21 amid further global oil demand recovery and a continued decline in OECD stocks to below the 2015-2019 average. The sweet/sour crude differentials narrowed in Europe and the US Gulf Coast (USGC) in September due to the significant oil supply disruptions in the GoM, mainly sour crude, higher margins of heavier products, and the well-supplied light sweet crude market in the Atlantic Basin. However, in Asia, the sweet/sour crude differentials widened on a higher supply of sour crude in the Middle East, soft demand from Asian refiners, and an unfavourable west-to-east arbitrage that supported light sweet crude values in Asia. Crude spot prices Robust oil market fundamentals and a rally in futures Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement markets pushed crude oil spot prices higher in US$/b September, rebounding about 5% on a monthly 90 average from August. Oil prices were supported by a 80 slow recovery from crude supply disruptions in the US 70 GoM as a result of Hurricane Ida. These caused cumulative losses of more than 30 mb, according to 60 the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental 50 Enforcement data. In addition, support came from 40 lower supply in other regions, including the Caspian 30 due to field maintenances, lower loading programs in several West African crudes, and temporary export Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 disruptions in Libya. OPEC Basket North Sea Dated WTI Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. Meanwhile, global oil demand continued to recover on the back of easing COVID-19 related mobility restrictions in several Asian countries, while the risk of a natural gas and coal shortage in Europe and Asia boosted sentiment about higher oil demand. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements In September, North Sea Dated increased by $3.60, or 5.1%, to an average of $74.40/b. The WTI and Dubai first month rose by $3.73 and $3.20, respectively, or 5.5% and 4.6%, to settle at $71.46/b and $72.57/b. The return of buying interest from Asian refiners, including China, rising European refinery crude intakes in August, and the sharp decline in US crude oil stocks in September, contributed to supporting higher spot prices. According to Euroilstock data, the crude intake of the Europe-16 nations rose 2% m-o-m in August, to stand at 9.21 mb/d. Higher refining margins also lent support. However, the physical crude oil market did not show signs of a supply shortage or any large deficit. Crude oil differentials registered mixed performances in the Atlantic Basin, Asia, and other regions. A softer physical crude market compared to the futures market was also reflected in a rising front-month for Brent-Dubai Exchange of Futures for Swaps (EFS), which increased above $4/b.

Crude oil differentials were mixed in September in the Atlantic Basin. Some grade differentials remained weak, mirroring a well-supplied crude market, while the upcoming autumn refinery maintenance season prompted some refiners to reduce purchases. For light sweet crude, a strong North Sea Dated and steep backwardation weighed on crude differentials. A strong Brent value compared with Dubai made Brent-related crudes less attractive for Asian refiners and limited west-to-east arbitrage. Light sweet crude differentials in Northwest Europe weakened in September, with the Forties and Ekofisk crude differentials falling on a monthly average by 92¢ and 76¢, respectively, to average a discount of 2¢/b and a 34¢/b premium. In the West Africa market, Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe crude differentials also weakened in September against the Brent benchmark. This was by a monthly average of 10¢, 28¢ and 13¢, respectively, to discounts of 60¢/b, 79¢/b and 70¢/b. However, healthy demand from China supported Cabinda and Dalia values. These rose m-o-m by 29¢ and 93¢ respectively, to stand at a premium of 10¢ and a discount of 90¢. 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements Saharan Blend crude differentials were on average 32¢ higher m-o-m in September, to an average of 32¢/b discount, although the crude differential remained at a discount to Brent. The Caspian CPC Blend differential fell further in September by 42¢ to a discount of $1.66/b on average, despite the prospects of lower supply from the grade due to field maintenance. In the US, a large production disruption in the GoM supported the value of crude in the USGC, although a slow recovery of refinery operations in PADD3 and lower crude demand limited gains. Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars crude differentials increased in September, rising on a monthly average by 55¢ and $1.13, respectively, to a premium of $1.38/b and a discount of 68¢/b. In the Middle East, however, the value of the Oman crude differential fell m-o-m by 61¢ in September to a premium of $1.59/b. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB value rose firmly in September. It increased m-o-m by $3.55, or 5.0%, to stand at $73.88/b. This was on the back of higher ORB component-related crude benchmarks, and an increase in official selling prices (OSPs) for grades delivering to Asia and US markets, amid a healthier physical crude market. Compared to the previous year, the ORB was up 64.5%, from $40.62/b in 2020 to an average of $66.83/b so far this year. All ORB component values rose in September, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend and Zafiro – rising $3.37, or 4.9% m-o-m on average, to $72.91/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy, and Kuwait Export – increased m-o-m by $3.65, or 5.2% on average, to settle at $74.44/b. Murban crude rose m-o-m by $3.52, or 5.0% on average, to settle at $73.41/b. The Merey component also rose m-o-m by $3.20, or 6.2% on average, to settle at $54.96/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices bounced back in September ending the month substantially higher compared with August. ICE Brent was up 6.2% m-o-m, mirroring investors’ perception of robust global oil market fundamentals this winter. Worries were fuelled by soaring gas, coal, and electricity prices in several regions and trading hubs, amid a potential risk of gas and coal shortages in the coming months. Earlier in the month, oil prices were buoyed by worries about tightening global oil supply amid a slow recovery in US GoM production, production maintenance in several regions, and signs of strengthening global demand, which resulted in a further decline in OECD stocks in August. They fell by 19.5 mb compared to July 2021 to stand below the 2015-2019 average. EIA weekly data showing seven weeks of consecutive declines in US crude oil stocks, which are now their lowest since October 2018, also helped push oil prices higher. Easing worries about the oil demand outlook, specifically in Asia, given the improving COVID-19 situation in major Asian countries, additional signs of a demand recovery and the return of crude buying interests in Asia further supported oil prices. Oil prices also found support from data showing China's crude oil imports rose 8% m-o-m in August, to 44.53 MT, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. Oil futures prices rallied further in the second half of September to their highest level in about three years. Prices were boosted by a bullish futures market, as soaring energy prices, specifically for gas, coal and electricity, amid a potential risk of energy shortages in the winter season, prompted investors to bet on higher demand for oil, which pushed up oil prices. Meanwhile, oil production from OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) continued to rise following the decision to adjust upward their overall production by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis starting August 2021. The recent 21st OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting reconfirmed this decision for the month of November 2021. However, the oil price rally was capped by a strong US dollar compared to a basket of other major currencies that rose to its highest in around one year, and as concerns about crude oil supply eased slightly later in the month as oil production in the US GoM continued to restart. According to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), 16.2%, or about 294 tb/d of US GoM oil production was still shut-in as of 23 September, compared to 76.5% two weeks earlier. Mixed economic data from China, including lower manufacturing activity in September, worries about the financial troubles of China’s Evergrande group, along with a statement from the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration that it would release oil reserves via public auction to domestic refiners, weighed on oil prices. Table 1 2: Crude oil futures, US$/b OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements Change Year-to-date Crude oil futures Aug 21 Sep 21 Sep/Aug % 2020 2021 NYMEX WTI 67.71 71.54 3.83 5.7 38.21 65.04 ICE Brent 70.51 74.88 4.37 6.2 42.53 67.97 DME Oman 69.31 72.99 3.68 5.3 42.32 66.52 Spread ICE Brent-NYMEX WTI 2.80 3.34 0.54 19.3 4.32 2.93 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: CME, DME, ICE and OPEC. The ICE Brent front-month rose m-o-m by $4.37, or 6.2%, in September to average $74.88/b, and NYMEX WTI increased m-o-m by $3.83, or 5.7%, to average $71.54/b. ICE Brent was $25.44 higher y-t-d, or 59.8%, at $67.97/b, while NYMEX WTI was $26.83 higher y-t-d, or 70.2%, at $65.04/b. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose m-o-m in September by $3.68, or 5.3%, to settle at $72.99/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $24.20, or 57.2%, at $66.52/b. On 12 October, ICE Brent stood at $83.42/b and NYMEX WTI at $80.64/b. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread increased further in September to $3.34/b. This is 54¢ wider than in August. The spread is now at its highest level since last April, and keeps US crude oil as a more attractive grade for arbitrage into both Europe and Asia. However, US crude exports remained low, particularly in the first decade of September, before recovering to just above 3 mb/d in the week to 24 September, according to EIA weekly data. The widening spread was the result of a sharp rise in Brent futures prices that was supported by worries about an energy crunch in Europe and parts of Asia. However, the rise of WTI futures at Cushing was probably capped by a slow recovery of US refinery operations in the USGC after Hurricane Ida. The prospects of additional supply from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in 4Q21 also weighed on the WTI price. However, the spread between North Sea Dated and WTI Houston narrowed in September by 57¢ to an average $1.91/b, on the back of lower supply in the USGC amid a slow recovery in GoM production. After significantly reducing their net long positions in July and for most of August, hedge funds and other money managers recovered parts of their combined futures and options net long positions in September. This was as oil prices rose to multi-year highs, and as soaring energy prices for gas, coal and electricity in Europe and Asia, likely urged speculators to bet on higher oil prices. Longer than expected disruptions in the US GoM also prompted money managers to raise their bullish positions. Between the week of 24 August and the week of 28 September, money managers were net buyers of an equivalent of about 108 mb in both Brent and WTI. However, speculators were more bullish about Brent prices as a global crude benchmark, while in the US, the end of the driving season and the disruptions seen in US refinery operations due to Hurricane Ida, probably reduced speculators’ risk appetite.

Combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent rose by 55,060 contracts, or 20.1%, to reach 328,954 lots between the week of 31 August and the week of 28 September, according to the ICE Exchange. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements During the same period, gross short positions fell by 4,230 lots, or 6.4%, to 62,141 contracts, while gross long positions rose by 50,830 lots, or 14.9%, to 319,095 contracts during the same period. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their positive positions related to NYMEX WTI in September, increasing by 25,125 contracts, or 9.2%, to stand at 298,042 lots in the week of 28 September. This is due to a drop in short positions by 94 lots, or 0.2%, to 54,166 contracts, and an increase of 25,031 lots, or 7.7%, in long positions to 352,208 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract rose slightly in September, increasing from about 5:1 in August to about 6:1 in the week of 28 September. However, the NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio remained at about 7:1 in the week to 28 September, the same level as in August. Total futures and options open interest volumes on the two exchanges rose over September, increasing by 6.8%, or 381,783 contracts, to stand at 6.0 million contracts in the week ending 28 September. The futures market structure The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in sustained backwardation in September on the back of expected stronger global oil market fundamentals in 4Q21, amid further global oil demand recovery, and a continued decline in OECD stocks to below the 2015-2019 average. Soaring natural gas and coal prices, and worries about an energy shortage in the coming winter season, boosted market sentiment about higher oil demand, particularly in the power sector. This contributed to supporting near-month forward prices and strengthening the backwardation structure, specifically the ICE Brent forward curve. The forward curve for Brent futures, as a global benchmark, steepened in September, compared to the previous month. This was evidence that the tightening of the global market is accelerating and reflected the prospects of strengthening global oil market fundamentals in the coming months. Oil supply disruptions after Hurricane Ida hit the GoM and limited crude availability in the Atlantic Basin contributed to a strengthening of the forward curve. The ICE Brent first-month premium to the third month rose m-o-m by 24¢, to a backwardation of $1.39/b. The ICE Brent’s M1-M6 also moved into deeper backwardation last month to settle at $3.10 on average, compared to a backwardation of $2.46/b in August. The backwardation structure of DME Oman strengthened in September. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 spread widened by 50¢ to a backwardation of $1.76/b in September, from a backwardation of $1.26/b in August.

Sources: CME and OPEC. Sources: DME and OPEC. In the US, the NYMEX WTI forward curve flattened slightly in the front, although the whole futures curve remained in backwardation amid healthy US oil demand, an improving COVID-19 situation in the US, and a sharp decline in US crude oil stocks in September. However, a slow recovery of refinery operations in PADD2 after Hurricane Ida limited the call on US crude, including from PADD3, which played a role in flattening the forward curve in the front. The NYMEX WTI M1-M3 month spread widened slightly by 1¢ to a backwardation of 68¢/b on average in September, compared with a backwardation of 67¢/b in August. In terms of the M1-M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread widened in September on a monthly average by 51¢ to a backwardation of $1.47/b, compared with 96¢/b in August. In the US, the WTI M1-M3 backwardation was little changed in September narrowing by 2¢ to 62¢/b, compared with a backwardation of OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements $64¢/b in August. The Dubai M1-M3 backwardation narrowed on average in September by 67¢ to a backwardation of $1.38/b. Crude spreads The sweet/sour crude differentials narrowed in Europe and the USGC in September due to the significant oil supply disruptions in the GoM, mainly sour crude, the strengthening margins of heavier products, and the wellsupplied light sweet crude market in the Atlantic Basin. In Asia, however the sweet/sour crude differentials widened on the higher supply of sour crude in the Middle East, soft demand from Asian refiners, and an unfavourable west-to-east arbitrage that supported light sweet crude values in Asia. In Europe, although the crude differentials of the Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC medium sour crude Urals remained in a deep discount US$/b to Brent, on a monthly average in September the value 8 increased, particularly in the Mediterranean. The Urals 6 value strengthened early in September on firm 4 demand, including from European refiners amid higher refining margins for the grade. The value of Urals 2 crude differentials wakened later in the month on 0 softening demand amid an unfavourable arbitrage to -2 the east, and rising supplies of the grade. Meanwhile, the value of light sweet crudes in the North Sea, as Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 well as in the West African and Mediterranean markets, remained under pressure from WTI crude Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals flows to Europe and a wider Brent-Dubai spread that LLS-Mars make moving light sweet crude to the east of Suez Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. market less economically attractive for Asian refiners. On a monthly average, the North Sea Dated-Urals spread fell to a premium of $1.75/b in September, narrowing by 91¢, from a premium of $2.66/b in August. In the USGC, the sweet-sour crude differential narrowed in September. This was mainly due to supply disruptions in the GoM after Hurricane Ida that resulted in considerable shut-in offshore productions for several weeks, including Mars sour crude production, hence, limiting the supply of sour crude in the market. The LLS premium over medium sour Mars narrowed m-o-m in September by 56¢/b, to $2.06/b. The value of Mars sour crude witnessed high volatility not only due to production disruptions, but also due to the slow recovery of refinery operations in the USGC that limited demand for crude. Contrary to other regions, the sweet-sour crude differential widened in Asia on the higher value of light sweet crude compared to sour crude, amid a higher Brent-Dubai differential that limited the flow of light sweet crude from the Atlantic Basin to Asia. The Brent-Dubai front-month EFS increased further m-o-m in September, rising by 31¢, to average at $3.64/b. Moreover, the gradual increase of sour crude supply in the Middle East, in line with the DoC decision, and a soft sour spot market amid limited demand from some Asian refiners, specifically Chinese independent refiners, contributed to a widening of sweet-sour crude differentials. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodities experienced a surge across the board, with natural gas and coal prices reaching record highs in Europe and Asia amid lower than average storage levels that fuelled concerns about potential shortages should winter temperatures be colder than usual. Crude oil prices rose on signs of an oil demand recovery in Asia due to the improving COVID-19 situation, as well as supply disruptions in several regions because of planned and unplanned outages, including the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) after Hurricane Ida. Base metals advanced led by higher aluminium prices due to limited output from China because of the power rationing measures, while declining inventories also contributed to the upside over the month. Gold prices declined following expectations of higher US interest rates. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index rose m-o-m by 10.1% in September, with components rising across all regions. The average index level was up by 73% in the January–September 2021 timeframe, compared with the same period in 2020. The non-energy index declined m-o-m by 1.1%. As witnessed in the previous month there was a decline in agricultural commodity prices, while base metals advanced. The non-energy index was up by 35.1% in the January–September window, compared to the same period of 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In September, the Henry Hub natural gas price rose m-o-m by around 26.2% to average $5.1/mmbtu. Prices strengthened on production outages in the GoM due to the impact of Hurricane Ida, some localized warmer than average weather that supported demand mainly in the first half of the month, and the expectation of strong winter LNG exports in view of escalating prices in Europe and Asia. However, towards the end of the month injections to storage amid moderating weather reduced the deficit vs. the five-year average. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 118 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 1 October 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 3,288 bcf, around 5.1% below the latest five-year average. At the end of August, stocks were 7.2% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe rose to a new record in September, with the average Title Transfer Facility price up m-o-m by around 48.1% to average $22.8/mmbtu. Average prices in the January–September period are around three times higher than the same period last year. As mentioned in previous MOMRs, inventories remain significantly low ahead of the winter season. EU Inventories ended September around 74.6% full – around 16% below the average of the previous five years – vs. 67% full at the end of August, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. The rising price of carbon emission credits continues to support natural gas usage in the power sector vs. coal, which also surged to a record high. At the same time, a directive from the Chinese government to ensure winter supplies has further supported Asia LNG prices vs. Europe, favouring exports to the Asian region. The surge in natural gas prices has resulted in record power prices – more than 300% y-t-d in some countries – and if this persists it would likely see a reduction in industrial demand. Some energy intensive industry representatives have suggested limiting output, or potentially closing some operations/factories for a period of time. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 7 Commodity Markets Australian thermal coal prices rose m-o-m by 10.8% in September to a record monthly average of $185.7/mt. In the January–September timeframe, prices more than doubled compared to the same period last year. As mentioned in previous MOMRs, the combination of strong demand for power generation amid warmer than average weather, a recovery in industrial activities, and reduced hydroelectric power due to drought, has led to low stockpiles of coal in main consumer China ahead of the winter season. These factors have led to electricity rationing measures that have affected heavy industries, and more recently to a directive from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to ensure adequate supplies before winter. Coal output in the country has been restricted due to mine safety directives. At the same time, disruption due to severe weather in major exporters Australia, Indonesia and Colombia have also contributed to the market tightness. China’s thermal power demand rose at a slower rate of 0.3% y-o-y in August, compared to an increase of 12.7% y-o-y in July, as a result of the beginning of the rationing measures. At the same time, coal output increased by 0.8% in August, compared to a decline of 3.3% y-o-y in July. Hydropower fell by 4.7% y-o-y during August. In India, there has also been reports of low coal stockpiles. According to Platts, citing data from the Central Electric Authority, coal stockpiles at power plants were at three-year lows.

Aluminium (RHS) Haver Analytics and OPEC. Sources: LME, Thomson Reuters and OPEC. The base metal price index rose by m-o-m by 2.7% in September, led by aluminium that saw average prices increase by a strong 8.9% to 2,834.6/mt. The price rise was supported by reductions in China’s output due to power rationing measures. Average monthly copper prices declined m-o-m in September by 0.8% to average $9,324.7/mt. Average prices in the January–September period were 57.4% higher than for the same months of 2020. Stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) declined by 13.2% to 219,525 tonnes at the end of September, suggesting strong market fundamentals. Estimations from the International Copper Study Group (ICGS) for the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in 1H21 showed a surplus 58,000 tonnes, vs. a 128,000 tonne surplus in the January–May estimation. This also supported the view of a robust market. Iron ore prices dropped sharply by 23.2% m-o-m to $124.5/mt. Average prices in the January–September window were 76.8% higher than the average for the same period last year. Prices continued their weakening trend as steel making activity dropped further in China on the back of power rationing. Global steel making activity declined by 1.4% in August 2021 compared to the same month last year, according to World Steel Association. This was mainly due to a drop in Chinese output of 13.2% y-o-y in August – vs. a drop of 8.4% y-o-y in July. In the group of precious metals, gold prices declined on average by 0.6% m-o-m in September, supported by rising real US interest rates and anticipation of some reduction in monetary policy support from the Federal Reserve in the coming months. Silver and platinum prices dropped by 3.3% and 3.5%, respectively. 8 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Commodity Markets Investment flows into commodities Money managers’ net length positions increased in crude oil and copper, but declined in natural gas and gold.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 9 World Economy World Economy The world economy has continued recovering strongly in the past months, however, at an increasingly diverging pace in the various economies and gradually challenged by rising uncertainties. The underlying assumptions for the GPD growth forecast are that COVID-19 will remain well contained and that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels. It is also anticipated that numerous additional challenges will not hurt the current path of the recovery. This applies especially to the ongoing global supply chain issues with potential longer-lasting effects on inflation. In addition, tight labour markets are seen to be temporary, a factor that otherwise may lead to rising inflation at the global level as well. Finally, very high debt levels, in both governments and the private sector, could provide substantial challenges going forward, particularly in light of a possibly longer-dated rise in inflation and a consequent hike in global interest rates. While it currently seems that economic growth risks are tilted towards the downside, upside risks could materialize as well. Further stimulus measures in the US, a continued strong recovery in the Euro-zone and a solid rebound in Japan could lead to stronger-than-expected growth in these OECD economies. Moreover, China may overcome the softening trend in the 2H21 recovery through governmental support and ongoing exportdriven momentum. India could also overcome the ongoing challenges through an improvement in domestic demand and a rebound in the export-driven services sector. With these uncertainties in both directions and numerous counterbalancing revisions among the various economies, the global GDP growth forecast remains unchanged for both 2021 and 2022 at 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively. The US GDP growth forecast for 2021 was revised down slightly to 5.8% from 6.1%, reflecting somewhat slower 3Q21 momentum, while the 2022 growth forecast remained unchanged at 4.1%. Euro-zone 2021 economic growth was revised up to 5% from 4.7% after stronger-than-expected 2Q21 GDP growth. Benefitting from the ongoing momentum, the 2022 GDP growth forecast was revised up slightly to 3.9% from 3.8%. The forecast for Japan was revised down somewhat to stand at 2.6%, compared with 2.8% in the previous month, given a softening dynamic in 3Q21. The 2022 GDP growth forecast remains unchanged at 2%. China’s economy is seen to grow at 8.3% in 2021 and 5.8% in 2022, a 0.2 percentage point downward revision for both years, reflecting the 2H21 slowdown with some expected carry-over into next year. Meanwhile, India’s 2021 growth forecast remains at 9% and at 6.8% for 2022. Brazil’s growth forecast for this year remains at 4.7%, and the 2022 growth forecast is unchanged as well to stand at 2.5%. Russia’s forecast for 2021 has been revised up to 4% from 3.5%, benefitting from OPEC-non-OPEC efforts to stabilize the oil market, while the forecast for 2022 was revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%.

Update on latest global developments The global economy has continued recovering in 3Q21, but at an increasingly diverging pace and faced with rising uncertainties. For various reasons, the first three quarters have shown differing trends in not only the major economies, but across the globe. While, in general, 1H21 showed strong growth at differing levels in most major economies, 3Q21 growth levels are now seen to have softened in the US, China and other key economies. This was caused by ongoing COVID-19-related issues, as well as by supply chain bottlenecks, labour market tightness, rising inflation and the implied risk of rising interest rates. In most major economies, there is an ongoing mismatch between order backlogs and the ability to fulfil the current magnitude of orders due to a lack of input goods and inventories. A shortage of semiconductors, among other input goods, has been ongoing. Bottlenecks in logistical capabilities have accentuated this problem. Selective labour market shortages have added to the challenges, and it remains to be seen if inflation will be a temporary issue as is currently seen by most major central banks. The labour shortage in combination with a resurgence in COVID10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 World Economy 19 infections has also dampened the recovery in the services sector. With rising COVID-19 cases, the sectors of travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure may be particularly exposed. As the services sector is an important driver for a full-fledged economic recovery, it will require close monitoring. The ongoing budgetary and debt ceiling negotiations in the US Congress, including on additional fiscal stimulus, are an additional area that has turned out to be more challenging than expected. This in combination with a softening US labour market and, to some extent, the ending of COVID-19-related social support systems seems to have impacted negatively recent domestic demand in the US.

Near-term global expectations While COVID-19 is expected to remain a dominating factor in 4Q21 economic developments, additional challenges have emerged. An important aspect and, to some extent, also a consequence of the pandemic is the issue of supply chain disruptions, which is contributing to rising inflation while, at the same time, global economic growth may be dampened by these effects, also in combination with potential rising interest rates. It remains to be seen whether supply shocks will be quickly overcome and will turn out to be temporary. Supply issues have certainly compounded and, in addition to weather-related events, have been lifting food prices. The latest inflation numbers in the US and the Euro-zone show no imminent easing of the situation. Producer price developments in emerging economies will also need to be closely monitored. Both India and China have experienced soaring producer prices, while consumer inflation has remained well anchored, but higher producer price levels could materialize, only with some delay. The current forecast assumes that COVID-19 will remain well contained and that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels. Entering the coming months and hence the winter season in the northern hemisphere, it will be critical that infection levels not rise too rapidly, especially in those economies where vaccine penetration is still low, as this may coincide with the seasonal flu virus and the usual arrival of the common cold. It is also anticipated that numerous additional challenges will not hurt the current path of the recovery. This applies especially to the ongoing global supply chain issues with potentially longer-lasting effects on inflation. In addition, tight labour markets are seen to be temporary, a factor that otherwise may lead to rising inflation at the global level as well. Finally, very high debt levels in both governments and the private sector could provide substantial challenges going forward, particularly in light of a possibly longer-dated rise in inflation and a consequent hike in global interest rates. While it currently seems that economic growth risks are tilted towards the downside, upside risks could materialize as well. Further stimulus measures in the US, a continued strong recovery in the Euro-zone and a solid rebound in Japan could lead to stronger-thanexpected growth in these OECD economies. Moreover, China may overcome the soft patch in the 2H21 recovery through governmental support and ongoing export-driven momentum. India may also overcome the ongoing challenges by an improvement in domestic demand and a rebound in the export-driven services sector. With these base assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is forecast to stand at 1.8% q-o-q and decelerate to 0.8% q-o-q in 2Q21. Some acceleration is then forecast to materialize in 2H21, with 3Q21 growth forecast at 1.1% q-o-q and 4Q21 growth at 1.0% q-o-q. The growth pattern in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally spread and in line with average historical patterns. Inflation is assumed to remain well anchored in the OECD economies in the sense that, in 2021, it will not significantly exceed the 2% OECD average on an annual basis and will stand at around 4% in the US. For 2022, these levels are forecast to stand at slightly below 2% for OECD economies on average and around 2.5% for the US.

OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments After the strong momentum in 1H21, GDP growth seems to have slowed down in 3Q21 in the US. 2Q21 GDP growth was revised up slightly to stand at 6.7% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This compares with the BEA’s initial assessment of 6.5% q-o-q SAAR. The widely watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker now stands at only 1.3% annualized growth in 3Q21, significantly below the Secretariat’s assumption of around 4%. In the meantime, rising COVID-19 cases in 3Q21, declining consumer confidence, a tightening labour market, inflation and reported supply chain bottlenecks are indicators that 2H21 growth will likely be lower than 1H21 growth. The ongoing budget and fiscal stimulus discussions in the US Congress during the coming weeks will remain an important factor. A bill by Congress to approve a temporary lift of the debt ceiling into December has only postponed a further debate on that matter. The fiscal stimulus that was envisaged by the US administration will also need further negotiations. Consumer confidence retracted substantially to stand at 109.3 in September, compared with 115.2 in August and 125.1 in July based on the index provided by the Conference Board. The Fed continued providing strong support, pointing to a continuation in its accommodative monetary policy, albeit, in the meantime, some officials of the Fed have pointed to a potential tapering, given the strong rise in consumer prices. US inflation remained high at 5.2% y-o-y in August, only slightly below the 5.3% in July. The strongest appreciation came once again from the sub-sector of transportation, pointing to the possibility of a transitory effect after the reopening of the economy. Prices in the transportation sector rose by 17.6% y-o-y in August, compared with 19.1% y-o-y in July. Excluding the volatile components of energy and food, inflation stood at 4% in August, after 4.2% y-o-y in July. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 World Economy The unemployment rate fell considerably to stand at Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market only 4.8% in September, compared with 5.2% in % % August.

Near-term expectations Near-term expectations have slowed somewhat as uncertainties have grown as reflected in the latest output indicators. Importantly, the draw-down from inventories was significant in 2Q21 and while inventories will likely be replenished in 2H21, supply chains will need to be monitored as an ongoing shortage of vital input goods like semiconductors could dampen this expectation. Another aspect that will play an important role in the nearterm recovery is the labour market trend as it remains to be seen if job-seekers will re-enter the job market. Positively, further fiscal stimulus – still under negotiation – may provide an additional upside to the growth forecast. In terms of quarterly growth developments, 1Q21 GDP growth stood at 6.3% q-o-q SAAR, and 2Q21 growth was reported at 6.7% q-o-q SAAR, based on BEA numbers. With the expectation of inventory restocking in 2H21 and further stimulus measures, growth levels for 2H21 and 2022 are forecast to remain sound. Growth in 3Q21 is forecast to reach 4.2% q-o-q SAAR, however, this is significantly below the previous month’s 3Q21 forecast of 8.4% q-o-q SAAR. Growth in 4Q21 is forecast to reach 4.6% q-o-q SAAR, 0.2 percentage points below last month’s estimate. Quarterly growth in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally distributed.

Growth in 2022 is forecast to normalize but will continue to be very well supported by fiscal stimulus, as well as ongoing accommodative monetary policies. These supporting factors and ongoing momentum are forecast to lift growth to 4.1%, unchanged from the previous month. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, but also supply chain issues and inflation, remain. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments Growth in the Euro-zone performed well in 1H21 and 2Q21 numbers were revised up again by Eurostat, the EU statistical office, to 2.2% q-o-q SAAR. The momentum is coming from a combination of fiscal stimulus, ongoing accommodative monetary policy and the successful reopening of most of the region’s economies that has lifted consumption. Moreover, the recovery in world trade was another supportive factor, especially for Germany, but also for the other major Euro-zone economies, France, Italy and Spain. The momentum seems to have carried over into 3Q21 and accelerated in July. It remains to be seen if that will continue as the latest rise in infections in some economies highlighted the ongoing COVID-19-related uncertainty. In addition, inflation rose further, which may lead to a gradually less accommodative monetary policy in the near term. The inflationary development is also accentuated by global supply issues that have led to price rises in input goods, which have especially impacted the manufacturing sector. Passenger car production in Germany declined further in September as output fell by a substantial 44.1% y-o-y, according to the German car industry association, the Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA). This marked the largest of four consecutive months of decline. At the same time, improvements in the labour market have continued and consumer confidence picked up slightly again in September. The European Central Bank (ECB) has maintained its accommodative monetary policies for the time being, while the inflationary gauges are monitored carefully. Inflation in the Euro-zone reached 3.4% y-o-y in September, up from 3% in August. When excluding the volatile items of food and energy, inflation stood at 1.9% y-o-y in September, up from 1.6% y-o-y in August. Lending to the private sector by monetary financial institutions held up well, rising by 2% y-o-y, but was below the two previous months’ levels. Still, the largest rise in lending activity continues to be seen in the real estate sector. Mortgages rose by 5.6% y-o-y, while lending to non-financial corporations retracted further and stood at only 0.1% y-o-y in August, compared with already low growth of 0.4% y-o-y in July. The labour market has continued to improve, indicating a clear positive trend. According to the latest numbers from Eurostat, the unemployment rate stood at 7.5% in August, compared with 7.6% in July, 7.8% y-o-y in June and down from 8% in May. 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 World Economy Retail sales in value terms have risen, albeit at a Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales slower pace than in the past months, with growth of % change y-o-y 2.3% y-o-y in August, compared with 5.1% y-o-y in 30 July, both on a seasonally adjusted basis.

Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations The healthy dynamic in 1H21 seems to have carried over into 3Q21, supported by pent-up demand after the end of lockdown measures and an apparent recovery in contact-intensive sectors. However, the rise in infections in recent weeks in combination with supply constraints affecting semiconductors, gas and other input goods likely dampened the momentum. With regard to the pandemic, it remains to be seen whether vaccination rates will achieve sufficient levels in the autumn and winter to prevent the further spread of new variants. In the meantime, fiscal stimulus and the ongoing accommodative monetary policies by the ECB are counterbalancing the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation to some extent. However, the supply constraints, if not temporary, are more challenging to manage. Based on the latest 1H21 revision, the quarterly forecast was updated, with even more emphasis on growth in 1H21. The underlying assumptions for the rest of the year and 2022 have not changed. It is anticipated that COVID-19 containment efforts in 2H21 will be effective enough to support the recovery and not derail the economy and the supply chain issues will be of temporary nature in such a way that they will not negatively impact growth. After reported growth of -1.2% qo-q SAAR in 1Q21 and 9.2% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21, GDP growth in 3Q21 is anticipated to reach 7.8% q-o-q SAAR, slightly below the 2Q21 level. In 4Q21, growth is forecast at 3.2% q-o-q SAAR. The September PMI for the Euro-zone economy Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs pointed to an ongoing improvement in the Index manufacturing and services sectors, though at a 70 slightly slower pace.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 15 World Economy OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Japan’s economy has shown relatively healthy growth, especially when considering that is has been continuously impacted by the pandemic for most of the year. 2Q21 GDP growth was reported better-thanexpected and indicators point at ongoing momentum in 3Q21. Emergency measures designed to fight the pandemic were lifted only at the end of September. With a new prime-minister in place now since the end of September and general elections coming up soon, the political developments remain to be seen. However, further stimulus after the elections, which were announced to be held October 31 seems likely. The latest mobility indicators, however, point to some negative impact towards the end of August, potentially influenced by the rise in infections. On the negative side, the ongoing supply issues that are significantly impacting the auto sector, among others, could continue to be a drag on growth in 4Q21. Growth in industrial production (IP) retracted in August on a yearly basis, however, the numbers continue to be distorted by the sharp declines last year. August’s growth stood at 6.3% y-o-y, compared with 13% y-o-y in July. On a monthly basis, IP fell by 3.2% in August, after a decline of 1% in July, all on a seasonally adjusted basis.

It stood at 36.4 in August and 37.4 in July. This points at a rebound in domestic consumption that is likely supported as well by further stimulus measures. Near-term expectations Japan’s economic trend is forecast to further recover into 4Q21, as the pandemic related impacts are forecast to taper off somewhat and also further stimulus measures are expected to be announced and implemented after the elections. Some slowdown in August and September was anticipated, amid the slowing activity in mobility as shown by the latest data. The further trend will, however, also very much depend on COVID-19-related developments. Also, supply chain developments may impact the Japanese recovery. Politics may prove to be influential as well, given the upcoming general elections at the end of October. By taking into consideration a somewhat lower 3Q21 GDP growth assumption, impacted by social distancing measures, the GDP growth forecasts for 2021 was slightly lowered. As reported by Japan’s statistical office, 1Q21 GDP declined by 4.2% q-o-q SAAR. Despite the lockdown measures in 2Q21, growth was reported to have recovered and reached 1.9% q-o-q SAAR, compared with the previous month’s estimate of 1.2% q-o-q SAAR. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 should then pick up further. Growth is forecast at 3.3% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21 and to accelerate to 5% in 4Q21. 16 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 World Economy The gradual rebound in the economy’s services sector Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs is also reflected in the September PMI, which rose Index significantly, but remains below the growth-indicating 55 level of 50.

GDP growth in 2022 is forecast to slow to 2%, supported by ongoing global growth momentum and stabilising domestic demand. This is also unchanged from the previous month. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments Economic activities in China continued to slow down due to the lingering effects of the latest COVID-19 outbreak and its containment measures, as well as the supply chain disruptions caused by the power shortages across some of the country’s provinces. Indeed, the strict “ zero-tolerance policy” may be weighing on private consumption at a time electricity shortages are disrupting manufacturing output and government housing control policies are weighing on property investment. According to Bloomberg, the strict COVID-19 measures may have resulted in slower growth in mobility during China’s Golden Week national vacation compared to pre-pandemic levels. On the fifth day of the Golden Week, the number of daily road trips taken where 33.8% below 2019 trips and only 5% above the 2020 level. On the consumption side, retail trade advanced by only 2.5% y-o-y in August 2021 following the 8.5% y-o-y level in July 2021 affected by the setbacks related to the re-imposition of stringent pandemic-related restrictions. These mobility restrictions might be dampening offline spending as e-commerce sales advanced by 12.6% y-o-y in 2Q21 following 10.9% growth in 2020. However, private consumption might see a modest recovery in 4Q considering that over 80% of China’s population would be vaccinated in the coming months. Moreover, the “zero tolerance” policy might help in reducing the chances of rapid growth in new infections.

Nonetheless, the impact of Haver Analytics. these developments on the overall economy might not be ignored considering that large developers like Evergrande own a considerable amount of its liabilities in trade and payables, which are owed to its suppliers. Consequently, this may influence the profitability and stock valuations of the companies that do business with Evergrande, including construction design firms as well as the material suppliers. Indeed, these firms might incur major losses and be forced into bankruptcy. In addition, limited credit access might adversely affect smaller property developers despite the current relatively healthy overall financial indicators. The latest trade data suggests that China's trade surplus stood at $58.34 billion in August 2021 compared with a surplus of $57.14 billion in the same month of 2020. Exports surged by 25.6% y-o-y to $294.32 billion, while imports jumped 33.1% to $235.98 billion. Nevertheless, the unforeseen growth in external demand might be slowed by ongoing supply chain disruptions as well as localized increases in COVID-19 infections. Moreover, global consumption might shift primarily towards service demand, which could result in a drop in external purchases of goods. Near-term expectations Supply chain disruptions and recent power outages along with COVID-19-related restrictions might adversely impact economic growth in 3Q21, while the government’s common prosperity campaign might risk deteriorating overall business confidence. The recent PMI indices mirrored the slowdown in Graph 3 10: China’s PMI economic activity in 2H21 especially with regard to Index manufacturing output.

Indeed, the increasing fiscal deficit is of high concern for the rating agencies despite low external debt and increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. Labour market pressures eased in September to 6.90% from 8.30% in August 2021, signalling increased control over the spread of the COVID-19 Delta Variant. On the policy front, the RBI left the repo rate at 4% in August, and the reverse repo rate was at 3.4%, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance aimed at supporting economic recovery and helping mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19. Near-term expectations Although the current infection wave may have peaked, India’s economic activities, in particularly in-person ones, might stay slow considering the slow pace of vaccinations. Moreover, concerns over the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and a new COVID-19 wave are high considering that the restrictions may have been eased too soon. For now, India’s low coal supply could trigger a power crisis as 70% of India’s electricity is powered by coal. Additionally, a coal supply shortage would threaten operations of commodityrelated businesses, including oil refineries, aluminium smelting and even meat processing, resulting in a potential stalling of the economic recovery. For now, the PMI indices have carried mix signals as Graph 3 15: India’s PMIs the manufacturing PMI increased to 53.7 in Index September 2021 from 52.3 in the prior month driven 60 by an expansion in manufacturing new orders as well 55.2 as an improvement in business sentiment.

However, international supply chain disruptions are weighing on industrial economic activities. Industrial production shrank by 0.7% y-o-y in August following 1.2% y-o-y growth in the month of July. The consumer confidence index dropped to 76% in August from 81.5% in June. Similarly, retail sales contracted 3.1% in September from a month earlier in August of 2021, and recorded the sharpest drop in retail trade since December of 2020. On the labour market front, the pressure continued to ease. In July 2021, the unemployment rate dropped to 13.7% from 14.1% in June. Additionally, the labour force participation rate rose to 58.20% in July from 57.70% in June. The inflation rate accelerated to 10.8% y-o-y in Graph 3 16: Brazil’s inflation vs. interest rate September 2021 from 10.4% in August, registering % change y-o-y % per annum the highest rate since February of 2016.

Near-term expectations The economy of Brazil continued to record a positive performance despite the global supply disruptions and the drought that has impacted agricultural output. In the meantime, the pace of vaccination has accelerated, and 70% of the adult population will be vaccinated by the end of 2021, which should further support a full reopening of the economy. Nevertheless, elevated inflation rates might weigh negatively on the economic recovery. The country's private sector continued to expend as Graph 3 17: Brazil’s PMIs indicated by the recent composite PMI, which rose to Index 54.7 in September 2021 from 54.6 in August 70 supported by advanced manufacturing activities as well as services output.

Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments South Africa officially announced the end of the third wave of COVID-19 given the significant decline in new cases and deaths during the month of September. The announcement combined with the recent registered uptick in growth levels would give economic activity a notable boost towards the end of the year, especially in sectors that are highly affected by the pandemic-related restrictions such as hospitality and recreation. Meanwhile, the annual inflation rate advanced to 4.9% in August of 2021 from 4.6% in July, slightly above the 4.5% midpoint of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range of 3-6%. On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased by 0.4%, easing from a 1.1% rise in the previous month. The South Africa Reserve Bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged in July at a record low level of 3.5%. Moreover, the reserve bank revised its CPI forecast for 2021 up to 4.3% from 4.2% and lowered it to 4.2% for 2022 from 4.4%, while keeping it unchanged at 4.5% for 2023. Meanwhile, the official GDP forecast for 2022 and 2023 was set to be 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively, unchanged from the bank’s May forecast. Regarding trade activities, the trade surplus expanded to ZAR 42.4 billion in August from a revised ZAR 37.01 billion in July. Exports rose 9.7% to ZAR 158.92 billion. Imports, on the other hand, increased at a slower rate of 8% to ZAR 116.52 billion. Near-term expectations The decline in new COVID-19 infections combined with the easing of restrictions along with the update of the country’s Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan introduced last year provided positive sentiment and a strong boost to economic activities. However, recent local political instability, along with recent headwinds in main trading partner China could have a significant impact on the economy in 2H21. However, the external demand boom witnessed earlier in 2021 may keep the recovery on track. The seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 56.8 in September of 2021 from 57.9 in August. The current PMI reading indicted that business is still impacted by the rioting and looting that occurred in July.

The Stanbic IBTC Bank PMI edged up to 52.3 in September from 52.2 in August, remarking the 15th consecutive monthly expansion. Yet labour market pressures continued to be a concern. Recently released national Bureau of Statistics data indicated that the unemployment rate increased to 33.30% in 4Q20 from 27.10% in 2Q20. However, both consumer and business confidence have increased, driven by the overall positive sentiments related to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and rising commodity prices.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 25 World Oil Demand World Oil Demand In 2021, world oil demand is estimated to increase by 5.8 mb/d y-o-y compared with 6.0 mb/d last month. Despite positive assumptions on oil demand going into the final quarter of the year, supported by seasonal petrochemical and heating fuel demand as well as the potential of switching from natural gas to oil in the power generation sector, the downward revision mainly takes into account actual data. Both OECD and non-OECD figures were adjusted lower; while the downward revision in OECD regions focused on 1H21, non-OECD revisions were concentrated in 3Q21.The world is anticipated to consume 96.6 mb/d of petroleum products during the current year. In the OECD, demand was revised lower by more than 0.11 mb/d in 2021, mainly to account for actual data. Lower-than-expected demand data for 1Q21 and 2Q21 in OECD Americas and OECD Europe was seen due to lower-than-anticipated transportation and industrial fuel demand. In the non-OECD, 2021 oil demand outlook was revised lower by around 0.03 mb/d compared with the previous MOMR, amid lower-than-expected data from China and India in 3Q21. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases reduced mobility in China during August, while the demand recovery in India was slower than initially anticipated. In 2022, world oil demand growth was kept unchanged compared with last month’s estimates at 4.2 mb/d. Total global demand is foreseen reaching 100.8 mb/d for the year. The main oil demand assumption remains as highlighted last month, with healthy economic momentum in the main consuming countries and better COVID-19 management. For 2022, the oil demand outlook takes into consideration an increase of 4.2% in economic activity with COVID-19 pandemic-related risks well managed due to higher vaccination rates and better treatment. In terms of products, gasoline and diesel are estimated to increase the most, supported by an ongoing recovery in mobility and improving industrial activity.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. OECD Americas recovered swiftly in 1H21 from the historical decline in 2020. Oil demand showed a strong rebound by around 1.4 y-o-y, with data from January to July compared with the same period last year. However, this increase was around 1.7 mb/d lower than the demand recorded during the same period in 2019. The recovery is led by strongly rebounding demand in the US, despite a weak start to the year, with rising infection figures limiting mobility and consumption for transportation fuels. Demand has improved, posting strong gains supported by an acceleration in vaccination programmes in the US, which led to improved miles travelled in addition to progressing industrial production activities, supporting demand for industrial fuels. Elsewhere in the region, demand in Canada continued to decline as heavy distillates weighed negatively on overall fuel performance, while Mexican demand was marginally higher, supported by additional demand for fuel oil. Despite a distorted baseline of comparison, demand for gasoline led gains in OECD America, as mobility indicators continued to trend higher during the first part of the year, with a respectable uptick in aviation activity towards the end of 2Q21. Both fuels increased by around 0.9 mb/d y-o-y from January to July. It’s worth highlighting that both fuels declined sharply during the same period compared with 2019 amid the onset of COVID-19 and subsequent prevalence of government measures reducing movement and limiting mobility, resulting a massive drop in transportation fuel demand of around 2.4 mb/d y-o-y. Additionally, healthy petrochemical margins were supported by steady end-user demand, particularly from the health sector, as well as the ramping up of new ethane cracker capacity, which supported demand for light distillates. LPG and naphtha demand increased by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y compared with the same period last year. This is compared with a decline of around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 1H20 over the same period in 2019. Diesel was up by more than 0.1 mb/d compared with 2020, supported by steady industrial demand. Most gains appeared in the US, supported by stimulus programmes and improving industrial momentum compared with the same period in 2020. Diesel demand in Canada showed a marginal increase, while posting a decline in Mexico. Near-term expectations Going forward, overall COVID-19 pandemic developments support optimism for short term oil demand prospects in the region. The economy is expected to remain strong, supported by various stimulus programmes. Some downside risks are linked to COVID-19 developments during the emergence of colder weather in 4Q21 and possible localized government countermeasures. Meanwhile, 3Q21 remains robust in terms of travelling activities and limited downside risks only arise from the impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior, as well as the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. In 2022, OECD Americas oil demand is expected to receive strong support from an encouraging short-term economic outlook, boosting oil demand by around 1.1 mb/d y-o-y, with US oil demand accounting for 0.9 mb/d y-o-y. Petrochemicals and transportation will remain the sectors requiring more oil in 2022. Gasoline demand will be backed by an increase in vehicle sales, while expansion in the petrochemical industry will provide support to light distillates in 2022. On the other hand, some challenges remain, such as COVID-19 pandemic developments, a continuation of fuel substitution programmes and fuel efficiency gains. 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 World Oil Demand OECD Europe Update on the latest developments OECD Europe’s oil demand increased by 0.7 mb/d, Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y, in July, following an increase of 1.6 mb/d, change y-o-y, in June, implying a recovery rate of 34.1%. mb/d Demand for all petroleum product categories showed 2 y-o-y gains, as a result of the low historical baseline 1 0.5 0.6 and increasing regional travelling activities in line with the removal of restrictions and amid warmer weather. 0 The strongest gains were for jet kerosene, light -1 distillates, gasoline and diesel.

Source: OPEC. In July, demand in the UK grew by 0.2 mb/d, while requirements in Italy and France increased by 0.1 mb/d, though in Germany they fell by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. Oil demand gains were eminent in all other countries of the region, coupled with travel across and within country borders. The industrial production index, which excludes construction, rose by 8.0% compared with the same month in 2020, as reported by Eurostat and Haver Analytics. New passenger car registrations fell by 23.9% y-o-y, following a 11.3% y-o-y increase in June. From January to July, European oil demand showed a modest increase of around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y compared with the same period in 2020, mainly because the recovery from 2020’s oil demand slump was affected by a slow start to the year due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in 1Q21, forcing the reintroduction of lockdown measures across many economies in the region. Within the big four consuming countries, demand performance was mixed. Demand in Italy and France showed decent gains of around 0.2 mb/d and 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, respectively. UK demand increased marginally, while in Germany demand declined by a hefty 0.2 mb/d. In the OECD region as a whole, increases in oil demand were attributed to gasoline, on road diesel and light distillates. An easing of measures to control the spread of COVID-19 resulted in improving oil demand across the region, with significant variation between countries. This can be illustrated in the mobility index, which reported increases of 66% from pre-pandemic levels in January to 128% in July and August. Preliminary data suggests further increases. Within countries, Italy and France showed the highest gains during the month of July, supported by an easing of restriction measures, as well as summer seasonal driving. The index was at 127% in Italy and 116% in France. Gasoline increased by more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 1H21 compared with a massive y-o-y drop during the same period of 2020 of 0.3 mb/d. Industrial production, an indicator for industrial fuel demand, also showed gains during 1H21. As reported by the Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics, the indicator increased by around 104.9 during 1H21 compared with 93.5 during the same period in 2020. The index uses 2015 as a reference. It’s worth knowing that diesel (including on-road diesel) and fuel oil dropped by around 0.7 mb/d y-o-y during the peak days of the pandemic in 2020 (January-July), while data from January-July 2021 show both fuels recovered only 0.1 mb/d of last year losses.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 29 World Oil Demand Near-term expectations Going forward, the outlook for the region’s oil demand for the rest of the year 2021 has improved since last month, amid COVID-19 containment efforts, increasing vaccination rates and falling cases; 3Q21 has proven to be robust and warmer weather favoured oil demand developments. The current outlook assumes that the pandemic will largely remain controlled in the coming months, supporting transportation fuel demand. The petrochemical sector will also be supported by seasonality factors, with naphtha being favoured due to its price advantage. A further upside could stem from high gas prices incentivising a switch to oil-based fuels largely in the power-generation sector. However, this upside is anticipated be limited and dependant on the severity of the winter season. In 2022, OECD Europe’s oil demand is expected to rise by around 0.6 mb/d. Positive projections for the economy, along with the containment of COVID-19, are the main factors supporting OECD Europe oil demand growth in 2022. Improvements in mobility, along with positive developments in the industrial and construction sectors, are expected to raise oil demand in the transportation and industrial sectors. Downside risks are related to COVID-19, as well as high debt levels and budgetary constraints in almost every country in the region. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments OECD Asia Pacific oil demand increased by Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y 0.3 mb/d, y-o-y in July, less than the corresponding change increases recorded in June of 0.4 mb/d. Gains were mb/d largely attributed to rising light distillate requirements 0.5 in South Korea as well as gasoline and diesel demand 0.2 in all countries of the region. Oil demand gained 0.2 additional strength from the Summer Olympics in 0.0 Japan. Demand for light distillates in Asia Pacific during July grew by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y after increasing by 0.2 mb/d in June. Transportation fuel demand was flat -0.5 y-o-y in July, following gains of 0.2 mb/d in June y-o-y. Oil demand in Japan and South Korea grew by -0.8 0.2 mb/d y-o-y. Preliminary data from by Japan’s -1.0 Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year indicate flat oil demand in August y-o-y. 2020 2021* 2022* Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. Between January and July, oil demand increased by about 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in the whole OECD Asia Pacific region compared with a decline of around 0.8 mb/d during the same period in 2020. Demand also declined compared with the same period of 2019 by around 0.7 mb/d. The recovery from the 2020 slump in oil demand was affected by an increase in infection cases in Japan and South Korea and most recently Australia and New Zealand, as regional restrictions remained in place for most of 2021, despite marginal support from the summer Olympic Games in Japan. The recovery process was rather slow, with jet fuel declining further from 2020 levels. OECD Asia Pacific light distillate demand increased by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y during 1H21, supported by a low baseline, healthy end-user consumption for plastics and the return of naphtha crackers from maintenance, particularly in South Korea. Demand for light distillates was at par with 2019 levels. Regarding transportation fuels, both gasoline and jet fuel were lower than 2019 levels, however gasoline increased y-o-y by around 0.05 mb/d as road mobility improved in Japan to slightly above pre-pandemic levels, though remaining below 2019 levels in South Korea. According to google maps and Apple apps, the index increased from 86% of pre-pandemic levels in Japan in January to 112% in July. Meanwhile, in South Korea the index was at 71% of pre-pandemic levels in January and 89% in July. 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 5: Japan’s oil demand, mb/d Change Aug 21/Aug 20 By product Aug 20 Aug 21 Growth % LPG 0.33 0.31 -0.03 -8.1 Naphtha 0.69 0.69 0.00 0.4 Gasoline 0.85 0.79 -0.06 -6.6 Jet/kerosene 0.19 0.18 -0.01 -4.7 Diesel 0.64 0.63 -0.01 -1.7 Fuel oil 0.17 0.23 0.06 37.3 Other products 0.20 0.22 0.02 12.1 Total 3.08 3.06 -0.01 -0.4 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding.

Australia and New Zealand’s zero COVID-19 policies are expected to negatively impact oil demand, at least for 4Q21. Overall demand in 2021 in the region is projected to increase y-o-y, with petrochemical feedstock being one of the main contributors to oil demand growth. In 2022, OECD Asia Pacific oil demand is expected to increase by 0.2 mb/d, under the assumption of an expanding GDP and COVID-19 containment. Gasoline will be the petroleum product category to increase the most, followed by industrial diesel, jet kerosene and light distillate petrochemical feedstock.

Near-term expectations Going forward, the outbreak of COIVD-19 in some Chinese provinces might lead to localized lockdowns. However, the low tolerance policy of the government is assumed to quickly control potential spreads. On the other hand, festivities during autumn will help boost driving activity, in addition to Golden Week holidays, which will also bolster gasoline consumption. The end-of-summer fishing ban, together with the autumn harvest season, will support industrial fuel demand in the coming months. LPG and naphtha will continue to back demand growth going into the final quarter of the year, supported by seasonal demand, with naphtha gaining advantage over LPG due to price differentials. Generally, improved economic activity, together with the rigorous control of COVID-19 infection cases, leads to the assumption that oil demand will increase solidly, led by transportation and industrial fuels. In 2022, China’s oil demand is estimated to rise y-o-y, supported by firm economic growth forecasts. The transportation and industrial sectors are anticipated to increase the most, with support coming from growth in vehicle miles driven, an increase in passenger vehicle sales and a firm industrial sector. Gasoline is likely to rise, followed by diesel. A strong petrochemical sector is anticipated to provide robust support to light distillate consumption in 2022.

Sources: JODI, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India and OPEC. Near-term expectations Going forward, India’s oil demand should continue to pick up pace after the monsoon season with the festive season, as well as improving industrial activity providing consumption support for the reminder of the year. However, uncertainty will remain high, largely associated with new COVID-19 variants, in addition to the pace of vaccination rollout programmes. Similarly, high retail prices and government reaction to those prices are to be closely monitored in the coming months. That said, oil demand is anticipated to pick up pace over the short term, encouraged by a low baseline and a rise in transportation and industrial fuel demand. The transportation fuel recovery is estimated to continue going forward, supported by better management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, transportation fuel demand is projected to lead product demand, followed by middle distillates. In 2022, oil demand is anticipated to increase by around 0.4 mb/d, with total volumes expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels on an annualized basis. COVID-19 containment measures are anticipated be sustained by an increase in vaccination, natural immunization and improved management of the virus. Regarding products, gasoline is anticipated to be the strongest product in 2022, supported by an acceleration in mobility, uptick in vehicle sales and overall steady economic development. Diesel is assumed to be supported by healthy industrial, construction and agriculture activities in 2022. Latin America Update on the latest developments Latin American oil demand posted steady gains for Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y the fifth consecutive month, increasing by 0.4 mb/d change y-o-y in July, after seeing a similar y-o-y rise in June. mb/d However, demand remained lower than in June 2019 1.0 by around 0.1 mb/d.

In August, oil demand increased by around 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in Brazil, after rising by similar levels in July. In contrast to August 2019, demand was slightly higher, mainly due to a steady recovery in industrial fuel demand, led by diesel. In August, transportation fuels showed strong performance as restrictive policies to control the spread of COVID-19 eased. Gasoline and jet fuel increased by more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y collectively, after rising by similar levels in July. On-road mobility was at 112% from pre-pandemic levels in August after posting 108% in July. Diesel increased on a y-o-y basis since September 2020. Demand for diesel in August increased by more than 0.1 mb/d, after rising by similar levels in July. Industrial activity increased at the beginning of 3Q21, up by around 1.4% y-o-y, though August levels are not yet published. However, they are anticipated to show an ongoing positive trend. Near-term expectations Going forward, Latin American COVID-19 cases should continue to ease as vaccination accelerates. However, variants will remain to be a downside risk if lockdown measures are reinstituted. Additionally, mobility is continuing to improve, which in turn will promote transportation fuel consumption. On the other hand, recent trucker blockades in Brazil were short-lived and did not materially impact industrial fuel demand. However, government policies in response to fuel prices will have to be closely monitored. Brazil is expected to provide support to oil demand recovery for the remainder of 2021, as transportation fuel demand is projected to pick up pace. From a product point of view, diesel and transportation fuels are projected to lead oil demand growth in 4Q21. In 2022, Latin America’s oil demand is expected to remain below 2019 levels but rise y-o-y. A steady economic outlook is anticipated to support demand in the region, mostly in the region’s largest-consuming counties Brazil and Argentina. Transportation fuels are anticipated to account for most of the gains in 2022, supported by COVID-19 containment measures and overall gains in economic momentum. Middle East Update on the latest developments Middle Eastern oil demand increased by more than Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in July, after rising by 0.7 mb/d y-o-y mb/d in June.

Sources: JODI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Going forward, as daily COVID-19 cases continue to decline, a return to normality is projected to continue in the coming months. Effective COVID-19 management and an acceleration in vaccination has led countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar to gradually lift movement restrictions, supporting mobility in the coming months. Generally, oil demand is anticipated to continue its recovery process to show respectable growth. COVID-19-related risks will remain, though at a lower magnitude than previously seen. Gasoline demand is anticipated to continue to improve, while gasoil will also rise on improved industrial activity. In 2022, Middle East oil demand growth is anticipated increase by around 0.3 mb/d amid sustained economic growth. Regarding countries, Saudi Arabia is projected to provide the largest contribution to oil demand growth in the region, driven by steady economic expectations, controlled COVID-19 cases and a healthy petrochemical sector. Transportation fuels and light distillates are the products expected to lead oil demand in 2022. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 35 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 (including processing gains) was revised down by 0.3 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to 0.7 mb/d y-o-y. This is mainly due to the drop in liquids supply in August by 0.6 mb/d m-o-m, mainly in OECD Americas, due to oil production outages in the US Gulf of Mexico (GoM), a force majeure at Canada’s Suncor oil sands site, and at the offshore platform in Mexico. Output disruptions also took place in other regions, including field maintenance in the Caspian. The US liquids supply forecast was once again revised down by 132 tb/d following the aftermath of Hurricane Ida and is now forecast to decline by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, Russia, China, Brazil and Norway, while output is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Indonesia and Egypt. The non-OPEC supply growth forecast for 2022 has been revised up by 0.1 mb/d, mainly in Kazakhstan, to now stand at 3.0 mb/d y-o-y. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are expected to be Russia (1.0 mb/d) and the US (0.8 mb/d), followed by Brazil, Norway, Canada, Kazakhstan, Guyana and other non-OPEC countries in the DoC. Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding the financial and operational aspects of US production remains high. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 are estimated to grow by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.2 mb/d and to grow by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2022, to average 5.3 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in September increased by 0.49 mb/d m-o-m to average 27.33 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids production in September, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have grown by 0.1 mb/d m-o-m to average 68.6 mb/d, up by 2.1 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply in September has grown by 0.61 mb/d m-o-m to average 95.93 mb/d, up by 5.39 mb/d y-o-y. Non-OPEC liquids production growth in 2021 was Graph 5 1: Revisions to annual supply change revised down by 256 tb/d from the previous forecast in 2021*, October MOMR/September MOMR assessment, including 172 tb/d in the OECD and 85 tb/d in the non-OECD regions, mainly due to a total China 15 downward revision of 604 tb/d in 3Q21, as well as Canada -16 317 tb/d in 4Q21. With this revision, liquids supply is now forecast to grow by 0.66 mb/d in 2021 to average Ghana -16 63.64 mb/d. Brazil -20 The main downward revision took place in OECD Americas’ supply forecast by 148 tb/d (266 tb/d in UK -32 3Q21 and 303 tb/d in 4Q21), due to oil production Kazakhstan -39 outages in the US GoM following Hurricane Ida, and a force majeure in Canada at the Suncor oil sands US -132 tb/d site.

Offshore production has been gradually returning in October, including the re-starting of production at the Olympus TLP (Tension Leg Platform) following repairs to a portion of its West Delta 143 offshore facility in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Royal Dutch Shell announced on 4 October. However, about 175 tb/d is expected to remain offline until the end of the year from the connection side of the West Delta-143 to another two TLPs, Mars and Ursa, due to damage. Shell expects to bring these volumes back online in 1Q22. Shell’s West Delta 143 offshore facility carries oil and gas from three major fields for processing at onshore terminals. According to Shell, the largest GoM oil producer, and hardest-hit by Ida, operations at other GoM assets — Appomattox, Enchilada/Salsa, Auger, Perdido and Stones — are all producing, except for Mars and Ursa. Around 60% of Shell-operated production in the GoM is back online after the incident.

For 2022, production is expected to grow by 0.23 mb/d and surge to 4.06 mb/d through continued production ramp-ups in Norway, the UK and Other OECD Europe. Norway Norwegian crude production in August grew by 59 tb/d m-o-m to 1.81 mb/d, 3.0% higher than the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s (NPD) forecast, and up by 81 tb/d y-o-y. Production of NGLs and condensates also rose by 20 tb/d m-o-m to average 0.30 mb/d. As a result, total liquids supply increased by 0.08 mb/d m-o-m to average 2.11 mb/d, back to the same level as in 1Q21, prior to seasonal maintenance in 2Q21. However, average liquids production in the first seven months of the year stood at 2.01 mb/d, the same as in 4Q20, despite the start-up of Equinor’s Martin Linge field in July, and the rebounding of production by around 0.2 mb/d over the low output seen in May and June due to seasonal maintenance, indicating no growth during this period. Nevertheless, with new projects such as Solveig, with peak capacity of 30 tboe/d, which came on stream by Lundin Energy on 30 September, and additional projects coming onstream by the end of the year, such as Duva, with a peak capacity of 30 tb/d, Yme, with 35 tb/d, and Martin Linge with 40 tb/d, Norwegian liquids output is projected to rise from 2.09 mb/d in 3Q21 to average 2.21 mb/d in 4Q21.

Latin America Brazil Brazil’s crude output in August declined once again by 0.05 mb/d to average 3.0 mb/d, despite a production start-up at the Sepia field in the Santos Basin at the Carioca FPSO with a production capacity of 0.18 mb/d. Longer-than-expected unplanned maintenance, however, led to lower output from other fields in the Santos Basin, such as the Buzios, Lula, Tupi and Lara. Many of these disruptions were due to COVID-related mandates and health regulations observed on platforms. Production at Buzios via four FPSOs — P-74, P-75, P-76 and P-77 — is operated by Petrobras and production rates are among the highest in the pre-salt province. The tender for the P-80 FPSO — a unit which will have the capacity to produce 225 tb/d of oil and 12 mcm/d of natural gas — has been pushed back to 2022. In August, total liquids production was pegged at 3.70 mb/d, including biofuels and NGLs, down by 0.04 mb/d m-o-m and lower by 0.14 mb/d y-o-y. Brazilian liquids supply in 2021, including biofuels, is forecast to grow by 0.05 mb/d y-o-y to an average of 3.72 mb/d, revised down by 0.02 mb/d.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Product Markets and Refinery Operations In September, refinery margins globally further extended their upward trend, with strong support coming from the middle section of the barrel. The tightness in product balances caused by supply side constraints in recent months was exacerbated by the beginning of the peak refinery maintenance season amid lower product exports from China. Middle distillates were the main margin driver in all regions and in Asia this upside was outpaced by robust fuel oil performance. Meanwhile, gasoline markets weakened as their crack spreads stepped down from the post-pandemic highs registered in the previous month, as the driving season draws to an end. Refinery margins US Gulf Coast (USGC) refining margins increased Graph 6 1: Refining margins by the smallest extent compared to the other main US$/b trading hubs, and slightly extended the gains 20 witnessed the previous month, as a robust performance from the middle section of the barrel 15 provided support and offset the weakness from the 10 top section of the barrel, as gasoline cracks stepped down from the post-pandemic highs witnessed in the 5 previous month.

The gasoil tightness, WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) combined with declines in refinery outputs during the Oman (Singapore) month due to peak refinery maintenance season, led Sources: Argus and OPEC. to a bullish gasoil market and drove gasoil to replace gasoline as the main margin leader in September. In response to the reduction in gasoil availability, US refiners were incentivized to maximize gasoil yields in detriment to that of jet fuel, which likely weighed further on jet fuel stock levels and contributed to the gains in US refining economics. USGC margins against WTI averaged $15.76/b in September, up by 28<U+023C> m-o-m and $9.94/b y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe rose and benefitted from firm product demand, a growing product tightness in the region as well as a fall in product output due to turnarounds in several refineries. In addition, supressed fuel supplies from Russia led to downward pressure on product inventory levels, despite weaker gasoline exports to the US. In addition, healthy European industrial activity as well as strong manufacturing output led to robust gasoil performance, which drove European gasoil crack spreads to a $3.08 m-o-m gain, which represented the largest monthly rise across the barrel in the Atlantic Basin. Record-high natural gas prices registered in September were reported to have affected European refineries adversely, due to rising electrical costs, which likely capped the upside in refining economics, and limited further gains. European refinery run rates in September decreased by 520 tb/d m-o-m, according to preliminary data, with the start of peak maintenance refinery turnarounds in the region. In the near term, offline capacity is expected to rise further in line with historical trends, which should provide supply-side support to European product markets in the coming month. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $4.48/b in September, up by 67<U+023C> compared with a month earlier and $3.71 y-o-y. In Asia, margins showed the strongest gains relative to the other regions, supported by low fuel exports from China, which kept product supplies in the region relatively constrained and helped limit excess product availability in the region, ultimately lifting middle distillates and fuel oil crack spreads. Moreover, a solid fuel consumption outlook, amid recovering industrial demand due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and increased usage of the fuel for power generation on the back of high coal and gas prices provided a further boost in Asian fuel markets. The rise in natural gas and thermal coal prices is likely to encourage increased gas-to-oil switching, supporting markets for residual fuel oil and gasoil, in the coming months. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia gained $2.28 m-o-m to average $4.66/b in September, which was higher by $4.01 y-o-y. 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased moderately in Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates September to average 86.13%, which corresponds to % a throughput of 15.62 mb/d.

The US gasoline crack spreads lost $2.83 m-o-m to average $26.40/b in September, but were up by $12.97 y-o-y. USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads rose in September to become the main margin leader across the barrel in the country, as jet fuel production rates declined m-o-m, while US jet/kerosene stocks fell by 1.1 mb over the month. A deliberate shift to maximize gasoil yields by US refiners, given that it was the product affected the hardest by unplanned weather-related outages witnessed in the recent weeks, likely added to the jet/kerosene bullishness. Furthermore, announced plans to relax air travel restrictions and allow foreign nationals to enter the US led to a jump in European flight bookings to the US, which ultimately may have contributed to the positive market outlook and supported jet/kerosene crack spreads. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $13.12/b, up by $3.87 m-o-m and higher by $9.69 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI saw further improvement in September and extended the upward trend affected by the lingering effects of sizeable cuts in production levels due to the recent hurricane-related refinery outages which led to a more severe product tightness in the US gasoil segment. In addition, a reduction in Brazil’s national biodiesel blending mandates amid the harvest season and lower biofuel availability resulted in added optimism with regard to higher gasoil exports to that country. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $7.58/b, up by $2.73 m-o-m and by $6.33 y-o-y. US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI strengthened further in September, sustained by supply-side cuts. Weakness seen at the top section of the barrel drove strength from complex configuration to their simple OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 53 Product Markets and Refinery Operations counterparts, as conversion economics became less attractive. Going forward, the start of the autumn peak maintenance season should support fuel oil markets as traders’ efforts to balance fuel supplies between the various regions are expected to boost bunker activity. In September, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $3.96/b, higher by $1.03 m-o-m, but lower by $3.07 y-o-y.

The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $8.47/b, up by $2.68 m-o-m and $8.63 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads showed a robust performance in September and represented the main margin leader across the barrel in Europe. Longer-dated ICE gasoil time spreads were in a contango market structure and climbed as diesel balances in the Atlantic Basin look increasingly tight for winter. Dec-21/Dec-22 ICE gasoil spreads widened as markets priced in several months of higher utility demand for liquids this winter. Gasoil inventory levels at the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage hub fell to a near 18-month low in lateSeptember. European gasoil prices rose to $84.35 and surpassed the post-pandemic record high $80.29 registered in July, in line with a m-o-m rise in crude price. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $9.95/b, which was higher by $3.08 m-o-m and $7.17 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads improved in September, in line with robust exports to outside the region. Robust requirements from Asia Pacific amid tight domestic supplies provided support. At the same time, an ongoing pick-up in fuel oil exports to fulfil higher power generation requirements going forward, amid the current high gas price environment should keep the balance tight and lend support to fuel oil markets in the near term.

Sources: Argus and OPEC. 54 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations In the middle of the barrel, jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia strengthened, supported by lower supplies from China amid firm regional requirements for domestic air travel, mainly in China. Firmer demand from the faster-recovering aviation sector in the West could provide some support to the regional jet fuel market, amid expected improvements towards the end of the year, as the vaccinated share of the population grows and seasonal heating demand for kerosene picks up. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $7.31/b, up by $2.63 m-o-m and $9.39 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread moved higher, supported by a solidifying demand outlook. Tighter regional supplies amid strong Australian demand for gasoil and lower flows into Singapore have helped draw stockpiles from the Asian fuel hub. Moreover, tighter supplies amid lower Chinese exports in the spot market and steady arbitrage shipments to the West provided further support. At the same time, recovering industrial demand due to easing COVID-19 restrictions and increased usage of the fuel for power generation on the back of high coal and gas prices provided further support. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $7.09/b, up by $2.69 m-o-m and $5.24 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spread soared in response to a pick-up in volume requirements from the power generation sector. However, despite the sharp improvement, Asian fuel oil margins remained in negative territory. This was partly attributed to the tightening fuel oil balance in the region, while fuel oil prices surged in Asia as some power generators sought alternatives given the high natural gas price environment. Demand from utilities, primarily in Pakistan and Bangladesh, have lent backing to fuel oil prices, which continued to support fuel oil crack spreads. The expected seasonal rise in refinery outages globally should boost bunkering activities, as traders seek to rebalance product volumes between the various regions, supporting fuel oil markets in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $3.39/b, up by $3.65 m-o-m and 8<U+023C> y-o-y.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 57 Tanker Market Tanker Market The dirty tanker market remained soft in September amid a continued imbalance between tonnage supply and demand, keeping rates at low or even loss-making levels. However, there has been a definite pickup in sentiment amid hopes for a good – or certainly better – performance in the final quarter of the year. Loading schedules for both Russian and North Sea grades show noticeable increases in tonnage demand at a time of steadily higher flows from the Middle East. As a result, ship owners are reluctant to take on extended voyages at current levels heading into 4Q21 in order to not miss out when better rates finally arrive. Concerns about a shortfall in natural gas and cold for winter heating demand could also lift clean tanker rates as countries import more diesel to power small-scale generators. Looking further ahead, a sustained recovery in the tanker market could take up to 12 months to materialize to allow for both a recovery in demand from emerging and developing markets and sufficient scrapping to reduce the overhang in tonnage availability. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures fell further in September, declining by around 1.0 mb/d, or 7%, to average 13.55 mb/d. Declines came as activity in Asia had yet to take off and buying slowed in Europe. Compared to the previous year, spot fixtures were 1.4 mb/d or 9% lower.

OPEC spot fixtures also declined m-o-m in September, falling by almost 0.6 mb/d, or around 6%, to average 9.39 m/b. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were about 0.5 mb/d or 5% lower. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East saw the only positive developments in September, edging up marginally from the previous month to average just under 6.0 mb/d, amid relatively steady flows to Asia. However, the route were around 1% lower compared to the same month last year. Middle East-to-West fixtures declined by 0.2 mb/d or more than 20% m-o-m to average 700 tb/d, amid lower flows to the US. This was a decline of around 0.2 mb/d, or more than 21%, compared to the same month last year. Outside the Middle East, fixtures declined 0.4 mb/d, or 13% m-o-m, to average 2.70 mb/d in September.

Y-o-y, sailings from the region rose 1.8 mb/d, or over 12%, compared with the same month last year. Crude arrivals in September declined m-o-m on all routes. Arrivals in the Far East led declines, down 0.6 mb/d or over 4% to average 13.6 mb/d. Compared with the same month last year, arrivals were sharply higher by 5.1 mb/d or 61%. Arrivals in North America averaged 8.8 mb/d last month, a decline of 0.3 mb/d, or 3% m-o-m, but 0.9 mb/d or 12% higher than the same month last year. In West Asia, arrivals slipped 0.1 mb/d, or around 2%, to average 7.1 mb/d. Y-o-y, West Asia arrivals were 2.3 mb/d, or just under 49%, higher. European arrivals remained relatively stable in September at 12.6 mb/d, down by less than 1% from the previous month but some 2.7 mb/d, or 27%, higher than the same period last year. 58 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Tanker Market Table 7 2: Tanker sailings and arrivals, mb/d Change Sailings Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Sep 21/Aug 21 OPEC 21.02 21.23 22.33 1.10 Middle East 15.73 15.96 16.53 0.57 Arrivals North America 8.67 9.07 8.76 -0.31 Europe 12.62 12.70 12.62 -0.08 Far East 13.54 14.19 13.56 -0.63 West Asia 6.49 7.17 7.06 -0.11 Sources: Oil Movements and OPEC. Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates saw a welcoming increase in September, gaining 11% m-o-m, with an uptick on all major routes albeit from low summer levels and amid higher bunker costs. Y-o-y, VLCC rates showed a similar improvement of 11% with all major routes performing better. Rates on the Middle East-to-East route rose 16% m-o-m to average WS36 points, amid a general uptick in eastward activity for the vessel class. Y-o-y, rates were 20% higher. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route regained the previous month’s losses, gaining 5% in September to stand at WS22 points, amid steady flows to the US. Y-o-y, rates were 10% higher. The West Africa-to-East route also improved, up 12% m-o-m in September to average WS37 as improving flows to China offset declines elsewhere in the region. Rates were 9% higher compared with September 2020.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 61 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports in September recovering from a slight dip the month before to average a healthy 6.4 mb/d. US crude exports averaged 2.6 mb/d in September, continuing an alternating pattern of rises and dips, this month on the lower side. US product exports hit a 16-month low in September, averaging 4.6 mb/d, amid broad declines due to hurricane disruptions. After four months of relatively muted levels, China’s crude imports jumped to 10.5 mb/d in August, pushed higher by the arrival of storm-delayed cargoes, although policy-led uncertainties continue to impact China’s trade flows. On the one hand, there have been delays in issuing crude import quotas to independent refineries; on the other hand, officials have instructed energy firms to ensure supplies at any cost. India’s crude imports finally saw a recovery after following a general downward trend since December 2020, to average 4.1 mb/d in August. Tanker tracking data shows India’s crude imports remaining steady in September, with higher inflows from the Americas and Africa, offsetting declines in the Middle East. Japan’s crude imports continued to recover from low levels, reaching 2.7 mb/d in August, the highest since April 2020. Japan crude and product imports are expected to see a boost from demand in the power sector for fuel oil as well as crude for direct burning, amid reports of a restart of oil-fired power units. OECD Europe crude imports remained close to 14-month highs in June, averaging 8.5 mb/d, while crude exports recovered some of the previous month’s decline in June, averaging 0.3 mb/d. Loading schedules show North Sea exports picking up in 4Q21. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports picking back up again in September to average a healthy 6.4 mb/d. Crude inflows were 0.1 mb/d or 2% higher m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, crude imports were 0.9 mb/d, or 18%, higher. US crude exports averaged 2.6 mb/d in September, continuing an alternating pattern of rises and dips, this time with a pickup of flows to China preventing a stronger decline. Compared with the same month last year, crude exports were around 0.3 mb/d lower, representing a drop of around 10%.

The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination for July shows outflows to Taiwan and India sharply lower and partly offset by higher exports to Europe, particularly the Netherlands. South Korea was the leading destination at 490 tb/d, followed by India at 370 tb/d and Canada at 310 tb/d. US net crude imports averaged 3.7 mb/d in September, compared with 3.3 mb/d the month before and 2.1 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US imports broadly reversed the previous month’s gains in September, falling to 2.4 mb/d, amid the winding down of the driving season. This represents a m-o-m decline of 0.1 mb/d or almost 5%. Y-o-y, product imports were close to 0.3 mb/d, or 13%, higher. US product exports hit a 16-month low in September, averaging 4.6 mb/d, amid broad based declines due to hurricane disruptions. Product outflows declined by 0.7 mb/d or around 14%, m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, product exports were close to 0.4 mb/d, or almost 8%, lower. 62 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade As a result, US net product exports averaged around 2.2 mb/d in September, compared with 2.8 mb/d in the previous month and 2.9 mb/d in the same month last year.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Preliminary data indicates that the US net crude and product imports averaged 1.5 mb/d in September, the highest since May 2019, driven by declines in products as well as crude. This compares with net imports of 0.5 mb/d the month before and net exports of almost 0.8 mb/d in September 2020. Looking ahead, US crude imports should be supported by seasonal strength in 4Q21. Crude exports are expected to remain at the current stable levels, despite higher prices as US shale producers continue to exhibit fiscal discipline. Product flows should pick up later in 4Q21, supported by seasonal factors and the return from weather-related outages. China China’s crude imports jumped to 10.5 mb/d in August, representing a gain of 0.8 mb/d or 8% m-o-m. The increase comes after relatively muted inflows over the previous four months which had been dampened in part by government efforts to reign in the refining sector, both on oversight and environmental grounds. Further factors driving the increase have been the arrival of some cargoes delayed by Typhoon In-fa, the secondwettest tropical cyclone on record, as well as improving domestic demand amid easing lockdown measures and preparations for the Golden Week holiday later in October. Y-o-y, crude imports were 0.7 mb/d or 6% lower, as inflows failed to match the exaggerated levels in the same month last year, when importers took advantage of low oil prices to build inventories. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia saw a strong increase to take clear hold of the top position in August, with a share of 18%. Russia saw its share drop to below 15%, while Iraq boosted its share to 13% and Brazil also saw a strong increase for a share of 8%.

Gains were primarily driven by fuel oil, which independent refiners have been increasingly turning to as a feedstock to make up for a lack of access to crude import quotas. Product imports rose almost 10%, or 0.1 mb/d, m-o-m and were close to 23%, or 0.3 mb/d, higher compared to the same month last year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 63 Crude and Refined Products Trade Product exports fell to a 13-month low in August, averaging 0.9 mb/d, as gasoline and gasoil outflows fell to the lowest since 2015. Declines came amid an expected pickup in domestic demand as mobility restrictions were lifted and as the government appeared to be questioning the need for high refined product outflows given the perceived environmental cost. Product exports were 0.2 mb/d or 19% lower m-o-m and down 0.2 mb/d or 14% y-o-y.

As a result, China remained a net product importer for the second-consecutive month in August, with net product imports averaging 0.7 mb/d, compared with net imports of 0.3 mb/d the month before and 0.2 mb/d in the same month last year. Looking ahead, policy-led uncertainties continues to impact China’s trade flows. On the one hand, there have been delays in issuing crude import quotas to independent refineries; on the other hand, officials have instructed energy firms to ensure supplies at all costs. Officials have also questioned the value of exporting products abroad, given the emissions produced at home, indicating that local refineries will likely be reluctant to step up product outflows to a noticeable degree. India India’s crude imports finally saw a recovery in August to average 4.1 mb/d, after following a general downward trend since December 2020. Compared with the previous month, crude imports rose by 0.6 mb/d, or almost 16%. Imports were also 0.1 mb/d, or 3%, higher than in the same month last year. In terms of crude imports by source, the latest data for July shows Iraq retaining the top position with a share of almost 27%. Saudi Arabia was second with around 16%, followed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with around 10%. The Nigeria was fourth with 9% closely followed by the United States. For products, imports rose for the third month in a row, averaging 1.1 mb/d, led by a strong jump in fuel oil, which offset declines in naphtha and kerosene. Product inflows in August were 7% higher m-o-m and around 21% over the levels seen in the same month last year.

Looking ahead, Japan’s crude and product imports could see a boost from the emerging energy crunch in the power sector, boosting demand for fuel oil and crude for direct burning, amid reports of a restart of oil-fired power units. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 65 Crude and Refined Products Trade OECD Europe The most recent available official data show OECD Europe crude imports remained close to a 14-month high in June, averaging 8.5 mb/d. Imports were largely unchanged m-o-m, but were 1.2 mb/d or almost 17% higher than June 2020 which marked the low point during the pandemic last year. Crude exports recovered some of the previous month’s decline in June, averaging 0.3 mb/d. This represents an increase of 21%. The gain came amid higher flows to Asia. Compared with the same period last year, crude exports were 0.3 mb/d, or around 45%, higher. As a result, net crude imports averaged 8.2 mb/d in June, down from 8.3 mb/d the month before and the 6.7 mb/d recorded in the same month of 2020.

Product imports were around 4%, or 0.1 mb/d, higher m-o-m. Imports were broadly in line with the level seen in June 2020. Meanwhile, product exports rebounded after two consecutive declines to average 2.6 mb/d in June, supported by higher outflows of motor fuels and naphtha, and to a lesser extent fuel oil. Outflows were around 0.3 mb/d or almost 15% higher than in the previous month and some 0.1 mb/d or almost 6% higher y-o-y. As a result, the region was a net product importer in June, registering net inflows of 0.2 mb/d, compared with 0.4 mb/d the month before and 0.3 mb/d in the same month last year.

Tanker tracking data shows OECD crude exports strengthened in September and loading schedules indicate further gains in 4Q21. 66 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – October 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Eurasia Total crude oil exports from Russia and Central Asia declined for the second consecutive month to average 5.8 mb/d in August. M-o-m, crude exports declined 0.2 mb/d or just under 3%. Compared to the same month last year, total crude exports from the region were broadly in line with August 2020 levels. The fall in exports was driven by declines in outflows from the Black Sea’s Novorossiysk port and on the Druzhba pipeline. Overall, crude exports through the Transneft system rose in August, as higher volumes on the Ust-Luga port terminal and elsewhere were enough to offset the declines via the Druzhba pipeline. Outflows via the Transneft system rose by 89 tb/d, or about 3%, to average 3.5 mb/d. Compared with the same month last year, exports were 0.1 mb/d, or 3%, higher. Within the system, total shipments from the Black Sea edged up 39 tb/d m-o-m, or 12%, to average 367 tb/d. Baltic Sea exports recovered some of the previous month’s losses, rising 138 tb/d m-o-m, or almost 15%, to average 1.1 mb/d. Shipments from Ust-Luga jumped 55% or 139 tb/d to average 391 tb/d, while Primorsk exports were broadly flat at 688 tb/d. As already noted, shipments via the Druzhba pipeline fell back from the higher levels seen in the previous month, declining 144 tb/d m-o-m, or around 18%, to average 707 tb/d. Kozmino shipments were unchanged m-o-m at 698 tb/d. Exports to China via the ESPO pipeline increased 55 tb/d m-o-m to average 633 tb/d in August. In the Lukoil system, exports via the Barents Sea declined by around 32% m-o-m to average 69 tb/d in August, while those from the Baltic Sea edged down marginally. On other routes, Russia’s Far East exports gained about 2% m-o-m in August to average 0.3 mb/d. This was 7% lower compared with the same month last year. Central Asia’s total exports averaged around 0.2 mb/d in August, representing a drop of close to 3% compared with the month before but a gain of 7% y-o-y. Black Sea total exports fell sharply in August, down 264 mb/d or almost 19% compared to the previous month and were around 5% lower than the same month last year. Outflows from the Novorossiysk port terminal (CPC) drove the decline, falling 21% or 286 tb/d, while exports from Supsa rose 27% or 22 tb/d. Exports via the BakuTbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline increased 9% m-o-m to 504 tb/d, but still showed a loss of 2% y-o-y. Total product exports from Russia and Central Asia rose 0.4 mb/d or 16% m-o-m to average 3.0 mb/d in August. M-o-m gains were seen in all major products. Y-o-y, total product exports were 29% higher in August, with gains seen on all major product except jet fuel.
