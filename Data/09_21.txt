Year-to-date (y-t-d), ORB was $25.42, or 62.8%, higher, averaging $65.93/b. Crude oil futures prices on both sides of the Atlantic moved sharply lower in August, reaching their lowest levels since last May, as concerns about short-term Asian oil demand, mixed economic data, and the prospect of higher global oil supply triggered a sell-off. In August, the ICE Brent front-month declined $3.78 m-o-m, or 5.1%, to average $70.51/b, and NYMEX WTI fell $4.72 m-o-m, or 6.5%, to average $67.71/b. Consequently, the Brent/WTI front-month futures spread widened in August by 94¢ to average $2.80/b, its strongest since May. The market structure of all three major crude benchmarks – ICE Brent, NYMEX WTI, and DME Oman – remained in backwardation, however, their respective forward curves flattened on uncertainty about the oil demand outlook, lower seasonal crude demand in Asia, and the prospect of rising global oil supply. In August, hedge funds and other money managers extended the previous month's sell-off, reducing their net long positions to the lowest since November 2020. World Economy Global economic growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 remain unchanged from the last month’s assessment at 5.6% and 4.2% respectively. However, this robust growth continues to be challenged by uncertainties such as the spread of COVID-19 variants and pace of vaccine rollouts worldwide, as well as ongoing global supply-chain disruptions. Additionally, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with inflationary pressures and central bank responses, remain key factors requiring close monitoring. In the current recovery, the US economy forecasts are unchanged at 6.1% for 2021 and 4.1% for 2022. Euro-zone economic growth remains at 4.7% for 2021 and 3.8% for 2022. The forecast for Japan is also unchanged at 2.8% for 2021 and 2.0% in 2022. China’s economy is seen to grow at 8.5% in 2021 and 6% in 2022, in line with the previous month’s assessment. Meanwhile, India’s 2021 growth forecast is revised slightly down to 9%, following a weaker-than-expected recovery in 2Q21, although growth for 2022 remains unchanged at 6.8%. Given strong growth in 2Q21, Brazil’s growth forecast for this year is revised up to 4.7%, while grow in 2022 is unchanged at 2.5%. Russia’s forecast for 2021 is revised up to 3.5%, benefitting from the stabilised oil market, while the forecast for 2022 remains unchanged at 2.5%. World Oil Demand World oil demand growth in 2021 remains unchanged from last month’s assessment, showing growth of 6.0 mb/d despite some offsetting revisions. Oil demand in 3Q21 has proved to be resilient, supported by rising mobility and travelling activities, particularly in the OECD. At the same time, the increased risk of COVID-19 cases primarily fuelled by the Delta variant is clouding oil demand prospects going into the final quarter of the year, resulting in downward adjustments to 4Q21 estimates. As a result, 2H21 oil demand has been adjusted slightly lower, partially delaying the oil demand recovery into 1H22. Global oil demand in 2021 is now estimated to average 96.7 mb/d. In 2022, oil demand is expected to robustly grow by around 4.2 mb/d, some 0.9 mb/d higher compared to last month’s assessment. Revisions were driven by both the OECD and non-OECD, as the recovery in various fuels is expected to be stronger than anticipated and further supported by a steady economic outlook in all regions. Oil demand in 2022 is now projected to reach 100.8 mb/d, exceeding prepandemic levels. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 is revised down by 0.17 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment, due to a downward adjustment of 0.5 mb/d in 3Q21. The revisions are mainly due to outages in North America from a fire on a Mexico’s offshore platform and the disruptions caused by Hurricane Ida. The estimate for North Sea production has also been revised down due to lower-than-expected output in 3Q21, resulting in an annual growth forecast of 0.9 mb/d to average 63.8 mb/d. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth remain to be Canada, Russia, China, the US, Brazil and Norway, with the US expected to see y-o-y growth of only 0.08 mb/d. The non-OPEC supply growth forecast for 2022 is unchanged at 2.9 mb/d, amid offsetting revisions, to average 66.8 mb/d. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are Russia and the US, followed by Brazil, Norway, Canada, Kazakhstan, Guyana and other countries in the DoC. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights 0.1 mb/d in both 2021 and 2022 to average 5.2 mb/d and 5.3 mb/d, respectively. OPEC crude oil production in August increased by 0.15 mb/d m-o-m, to average 26.76 mb/d, according to available secondary sources. Product Markets and Refining Operations Global refinery margins continued to trend upwards, supported by the seasonal strength in transportation fuels, amid easing mobility restrictions. In the US, product markets were supported by a reduction in total product inventory levels, while seasonal support pushed gasoline margins to new record highs. In Europe, refining margins benefitted from a positive performance across the barrel, while a contraction in fuel outputs from key traditional fuel suppliers within the region helped strengthen European product markets. Meanwhile, in Asia, weakness from rising regional fuel output levels were overshadowed by the robust performance in the jet fuelkerosene and fuel oil markets, driven by an improvement in summer-related air travel and cooling requirements. Robust fuel consumption levels in India added to the upturn in regional refining economics. Tanker Market The VLCC tanker rates remained at depressed levels in August, weighed down by ample tonnage availability despite increased tanker demand. Suezmax and Aframax rates managed a better performance in intra-Asian routes, as well as the Atlantic basin, particularly from West Africa to the US Gulf. Clean tanker rates showed a healthy improvement East of Suez but slipped in the West. The arrival of Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the month resulted in temporary dislocations, lending some support to dirty Aframax rates, while depressing clean rates in the early days of September as Gulf Coast refineries remain offline. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports averaged 6.3 mb/d in August, while crude exports recovered to just under 3.0 mb/d. US product imports rose m-o-m to a robust 2.6 mb/d, while product exports averaged 5.3 mb/d in August, as lower demand from Latin America offset higher flows to Asia. Disruptions caused by Hurricane Ida at the end of August will likely impact these crude and product flows in September, as oil installations along the US Gulf Coast seek to restart. China’s crude imports averaged 9.7 mb/d in July, remaining relatively flat since April, although recently released data for August shows crude inflows jumping to 10.5 mb/d now that refiners have a further round of quotas. India’s crude imports continued to fall in July, averaging 3.6 mb/d, but positive expectations remain for a pick-up in August, as state-owned refiners look to increase runs to maximum capacity during 4Q21. Japan’s crude imports averaged 2.1 mb/d in July, as the country’s COVID-19 state of emergency continued to weigh on refinery runs amid uncertainty about product demand. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data shows total OECD commercial oil stocks up by 10.5 mb m-o-m in July. At 2,912 mb, inventories were 305.9 mb lower than the same month a year ago; 122 mb below the latest five-year average; and 57.2 mb lower than the 2015-2019 average. Within components, crude stocks fell by 5.6 mb m-o-m while product stocks rose by 16.1 mb. At 1,404 mb, crude stocks in the OECD were 106.9 mb below the latest five-year average and 80.0 mb below the 2015-2019 average. Meanwhile, OECD product stocks averaged 1,508 mb, representing a deficit of 15.1 mb compared with latest five-year average, but 22.7 mb above the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks rose 0.1 day m-o-m to stand at 63.7 days in July. This is 11.6 days below the same month last year and 1.2 days below the latest five-year average, but 1.5 days above the 2015-2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 is revised up by 0.3 mb/d from last month’s assessment to stand at 27.7 mb/d, representing an increase of 4.9 mb/d over the previous year. Demand for OPEC crude in 2022 is revised up by 1.1 mb/d to stand at 28.7 mb/d, around 1.1 mb/d higher than in 2021. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Assessment of the global economy in 2021 and 2022 Although the global economy continues to be Graph 1: GDP growth forecast for 2021-22 affected by developments related to World 5.6 COVID-19, 1H21 saw a healthy economic recovery. 4.2 2021* Following the strong quarterly economic growth in 2022* 3Q21, growth is forecast to slightly decelerate US 4.1 6.1 towards the end of the year.

Source: OPEC. dampen current growth projections. In addition, ongoing global supply chain disruptions, rising sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with inflationary pressures and central bank responses, remain key factors that require close monitoring. Healthy growth is also projected for 2022, with the GDP rising by 4.2%. This will be supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus and continued efforts to contain COVID-19 infections. Upside to both annual growth levels may come from further US fiscal stimulus and improvements in developments related to COVID-19. In terms of a geographical breakdown, the OECD shows a strong rebound in 2021, led by the US. US growth is forecast at 6.1% in 2021, supported by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. This is followed by projected growth of 4.1% in 2022, with further potential upside that may come from additional fiscal stimulus. Growth in the Euro-zone has also picked up strongly, especially in 2Q21, with economic growth for the entire year forecast at 4.7%, followed by 3.8% in 2022. Japan is facing ongoing COVID-19related challenges and its economy is forecast to expand by 2.8% in 2021 and by 2% in 2022, albeit current domestic political changes and potential fiscal decisions may require revisions to these projections in the months to come. In the non-OECD, the economic recovery has Graph 2: World oil demand growth in 2021-22 continued, though the pace and dynamics vary within mb/d the regions. China’s 1H21 GDP figures confirmed a 7 6.0 stable economic recovery, albeit the renewed 6 COVID-19 variant outbreak is forecast to limit 2021 5 4.2 growth at 8.5%.

Growth forecasts for 0 2021* 2022* 2021 in Brazil and Russia stand at 4.7% and at 3.5%, OECD Americas China Others World respectively, followed by 2022 growth of 2.5% in both economies. However, rising inflationary pressures Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. have already led Brazil and Russia to lift key interest rates in recent months, potentially dampening the recovery going forward. The global economic recovery, in combination with a considerable rebound in mobility, significantly lifted oil demand growth in 1H21. While this dynamic is forecast to soften towards the end of 2021, the overall positive trend has led to projected global oil demand growth of 6.0 mb/d for 2021, followed by growth of 4.2 mb/d in 2022. Non-OPEC supply is expected to grow by 0.9 mb/d in 2021, followed by forecast growth of 2.9 mb/d in 2022. Nevertheless, numerous uncertainties, including the continued COVID-19 impact on the global economic recovery, will require continued coordinated policies, including the commendable efforts undertaken by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), to ensure stability and balance for the global oil market.

In August, North Sea Dated and Dubai's first month dropped m-o-m by $4.19 and $3.46, respectively, or 5.6% and 4.8%, to settle at $70.80/b and $69.37/b. The WTI first month fell the most among benchmarks, declining by $4.85 m-o-m, or 6.7%, to settle at $67.73/b. The ORB value fell by $3.20 on average in August to settle at $70.33/b, a m-o-m decline of 4.4%, and its largest drop since September 2020. ORB component values dropped on a sharp decline of their related crude benchmarks, offsetting a higher monthly change in their respective official selling price differentials for all components to the Asian market, and most components to the European market. Crude oil futures prices on both sides of the Atlantic moved sharply lower during the first three weeks of August. They fell to their lowest levels since last May amid deteriorating market sentiment, as concerns about short-term oil demand outlooks in Asia, mixed economic data, and the prospects of higher global oil supply triggered a sharp sell-off. However, oil prices recouped some of their previous losses in the last week of August, after concerns about weakening oil demand eased. Large declines in US crude oil stocks and supply disruptions in Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico also contributed to support oil prices. The ICE Brent front-month in August fell m-o-m by $3.78, or 5.1%, to average $70.51/b, and NYMEX WTI dropped by $4.72 m-o-m, or 6.5%, to average $67.71/b. DME Oman crude oil futures prices declined by $3.42 m-o-m, or 4.7%, to settle at $69.31/b. As oil prices dropped, hedge funds and other money managers extended the previous month’s sell-off and massively reduced their net long positions in the first three weeks of August, hitting their lowest level since November 2020. Although the market structure of all three major oil benchmarks – ICE Brent, NYMEX WTI, and DME Oman – remained in backwardation, uncertainty about the short-term oil demand outlook, lower seasonal crude demand in Asia, and the prospect of rising global oil supply flattened the backwardation forward curves. The sweet/sour crude differentials widened in Europe and the US Gulf Coast (USGC) on more robust margins of light sweet crudes compared to heavier crudes, and a plentiful supply of sour crude. Strong margins for naphtha and gasoline supported the value of light sweet grades. However, in Asia, the sweet/sour crude differentials narrowed as the sweet crude value fell more than that for sour crude. Crude spot prices Crude oil spot prices fell in August, the largest Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement monthly drop since September 2020. The main crude US$/b spot benchmarks fell to their lowest monthly average 80 since May 2021. In August, North Sea Dated and Dubai's first month dropped m-o-m by $4.19 and 70 $3.46, respectively, or 5.6% and 4.8%, to settle at 60 $70.80/b and $69.37/b. WTI first month fell the most 50 among the benchmarks, declining by $4.85 m-o-m, or 6.7%, to settle at $67.73/b. 40 30 Spot prices were under pressure in August due to Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 slowdown in buying interest from Asia, specifically from China, and rising volumes of unsold crude cargoes for August and September loadings, with sellers struggling to clear crude.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements Strong buying from Chinese refiners that supported the market in previous months slowed in August, amid limited crude import quotas for independent refiners in China, lower refinery runs, and prospects for weaker oil demand, due to lower mobility levels resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns, as well as bad weather. Furthermore, data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed a m-o-m decline in China’s processing volumes of crude oil to 59.06 million tons in July, compared to 60.82 million tons in June. The crude oil processing volumes in July was 0.9% lower compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, global oil production continued to rise gradually. OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) have agreed to adjust upward their overall production by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis starting August 2021. Several other non-OPEC producers also raised their production in July.

The physical market’s soft fundamentals were also reflected in the decline of many regional crude oil differentials, including in the North Sea, the Mediterranean, West Africa, and some East Suez crude markets. West African, Mediterranean, and Caspian crude oil differentials extended their declines in August on weak crude demand from Asian refiners, particularly in China, the availability of prompt unsold cargoes, and the steady flow of light sweet crude from the US to Europe. Despite a decline in EFS Dubai, making west-to-east arbitrage more favourable, it did not trigger strong demand from Asia, while firm refining margins for gasoline and naphtha in the US and Europe lent limited support to light sweet crude values. Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe crude differentials fell further in August and flipped to discount to North Sea Dated, falling by a monthly average of 81¢, 89¢, and 93¢, respectively, to stand at discounts of 50¢/b, 51¢/b, and 58¢/b. The crude differential of medium-heavy sweet Cabinda fell m-o-m by 53¢ in August to settle at a discount of 19¢/b. Saharan Blend crude differentials also averaged lower, dropping by 59¢/b m-o-m to stand at a discount of 64¢/b on average. However, the Caspian CPC Blend differential rose slightly m-o-m in August, increasing by 22¢, although it remained at a deep discount to North Sea Dated, averaging at $1.24/b. 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements In Northwest Europe, North Sea crude differentials weakened in August despite healthy refining margins, the prospect of a lower September loading programs, and strong gasoline cracks, although the decline in North Sea crude differentials was less than for similar crude in West African and Mediterranean markets. The Forties and Ekofisk crude differentials rose by 89¢ and 67¢, respectively, on a monthly average in July to settle at a premium of $1.09/b and $1.25/b. In the Middle East, crude differentials to Dubai weakened slightly on the spot market in August amid soft demand from Asia Pacific refiners and weak middle distillate margins. The value of the Oman crude differential fell by 25¢ m-o-m in August to a premium of $2.20/b. In the USGC, however, coastal crude differentials of Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars to WTI strengthened m-o-m in August, increasing by 26¢ and 20¢, respectively, on a monthly average, to a premium of 83¢/b and a discount of $1.81/b. The widening Brent-WTI spread helped support waterborne crude differentials. Nonetheless, crude spot prices recovered part of their losses in the third decade of August as concerns about oil demand in Asia-Pacific regions eased and oil demand in the US and Europe continued to show signs of strength. Moreover, EIA weekly data showed a large drop in US crude oil stocks in August. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) After a significant recovery for three consecutive months, the ORB value fell on average by $3.20 in August to settle at $70.33/b. This is a m-o-m decline of 4.4%, its largest monthly drop since September 2020. The ORB component values fell on a sharp decline of related crude benchmarks, which offset a higher monthly change in their respective official selling price differentials for all components to the Asian market, and most components to the European market. However, the y-t-d ORB was up by $25.42, or 62.8%, from $40.50/b in 2020 to an average of $65.93/b so far this year. All ORB component values fell in August, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend, and Zafiro – declining on average the most m-o-m, dropping by $4.40, or 5.9%, to $69.54/b. Multiple region destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy, and Kuwait Export – fell m-o-m by $2.80, or 3.8%, on average, to settle at $70.79/b. Murban crude fell m-o-m by $3.75, or 5.1%, on average, to settle at $69.89/b. The Merey component dropped m-o-m by $2.73, or 5.0%, on average, to settle at $51.76/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices on both sides of the Atlantic moved sharply lower during the first three weeks of August. ICE Brent ticked down by $3.78, or 5.1%, on a monthly average, to settle at $70.51/b, while NYMEX WTI dropped by $4.72, or 6.5%, to stand at $67.71/b. Downside pressure was witnessed on futures prices as the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, along with renewed local lockdowns and tightening mobility restrictions, particularly in several Asian countries, including China, weighed on market sentiment and raised worries about the short-term oil demand outlook. This was in addition to signs of softening oil demand in major consuming countries, including China and Japan. ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI fell $11.15 and $11.63, respectively, or 14.6% and 15.7%, between late July and the end of the week to 20 August.

The decline in oil prices came alongside a broader commodity sell-off as investors eyed the prospect of reduced US economic stimulus, as well as a strong US dollar against a basket of other major currencies that hit its highest level on a daily basis since November 2020. The sell-off from hedge funds and other money managers contributed to pushing oil prices lower. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements Investors were also assessing the expected higher oil production from OPEC and non-OPEC participants in the DoC, as well as higher production from other non-OPEC producers, including the US. Additionally, the US Department of Energy (DoE) announced it intends to sell up to 20 mb of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during 4Q21, and market sources indicated that China and India are drawing crude oil from their domestic stocks. Oil prices, however, started to recover in the last decade of August and recouped part of the earlier monthly losses. This was after concerns about oil demand eased amid signs the latest surge of COVID-19 cases across Asia was slowing, and in China, the recent spread of the virus had been rapidly contained, which would help avoid further lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Market sentiment was bolstered further after the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received full regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, which could contribute to rising vaccination rates. Oil prices were also positively supported by worries about short-term oil supply disruptions. Mexico witnessed an oil production disruption in August of about 421 kb/d, which lasted several days, due to a fire on an oil offshore platform operated by Pemex. In the US, oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut for several days after energy companies evacuated platforms ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Ida. A decline in US crude oil stocks for four consecutive weeks in August, dropping to their lowest level since September 2019, also added support. The ICE Brent front-month fell by $3.78 m-o-m, or 5.1%, in August to average $70.51/b, and NYMEX WTI declined m-o-m by $4.72, or 6.5%, to average $67.71/b. However, ICE Brent was $24.47 higher y-t-d, or 57.4%, at $67.08/b, and NYMEX WTI was $26.20 higher, or 68.9%, at $64.23/b, compared with the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices declined in August by $3.42 m-o-m, or 4.7%, to settle at $69.31/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $23.28, or 54.9%, at $65.71/b. On 10 September, ICE Brent stood at $72.92/b and NYMEX WTI at $69.72/b. After narrowing to below $2/b in July, the transatlantic spread between the benchmarks – NYMEX WTI and ICE Brent – widened significantly by 94¢ in August to average $2.80/b, its highest level since May. However, the spread remained relatively narrow, below $3/b on average. The Brent-WTI spread widened significantly in the second part of the month as the price recovery of NYMEX WTI was slower compared to ICE Brent, partly on the back of expectations for higher US shale oil output in September, according to EIA forecasts, the prospects of additional supply from the US SPR in 4Q21, and significant refinery capacity shutdowns and slowing crude demand due to Hurricane Ida. Additionally, signs of a possible decision by the US Federal Reserve to taper the stimulus sooner than market expectations probably weighed more on NYMEX WTI. A wider Brent-WTI spread improved US export economics making US crude more competitive in Europe and Asia. In the first four weeks of August, US crude oil exports rose to 3.0 mb/d on average, according to EIA data, compared to 2.7 mb/d during the previous month. The North Sea Dated premium to WTI Houston also widened in August, by 37¢ m-o-m, to average $2.48/b. As oil prices fell, hedge funds and other money managers extended the previous month’s sell-off and massively reduced their net long positions in the first three weeks of August, hitting their lowest level since November 2020. Speculators turned negative on deteriorating market sentiment and rising worries about deteriorating global oil demand amid the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, while at the same time global oil supply is projected to increase. In the week to 24 August, combined futures and options net long positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI were reduced by 197,067 contracts, or 27.5%, compared with the level in the week to 29 June. Nonetheless, speculators recovered some of their net long positions in the week to 31 August after oil prices rose. In terms of both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI between the week of 27 July and the week ending 31 August, money managers were net sellers of about 86 mb. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements Graph 1 2: NYMEX WTI vs. Managed Money Graph 1 3: ICE Brent vs. Managed Money net long positions net long positions US$/b 1,000 contracts US$/b 1,000 contracts 80 500 80 500 400 400 60 60 300 300 200 200 40 40 100 100 20 0 20 0 Feb 21 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Managed money net long positions (RHS) Managed money net long positions (RHS) NYMEX WTI (LHS) ICE Brent (LHS) Sources: CFTC, CME and OPEC.

Compared with the week to 27 July, combined futures and options net long positions in Brent fell by 37,765 contracts, or 12.1%, to reach 273,894 lots in the week to 31 August, according to the ICE Exchange. In the week ending 31 August, gross short positions fell by 13,245 lots, or 16.6%, to 66,371 contracts, and gross long positions declined by 51,010 lots, or 13.0%, to 340,265 contracts during the same period. Combined WTI futures and options net long positions fell by 48,318 contracts, or 15.0%, to 272,917 lots in the week to 31 August. This was due to a rise in short positions by 7,542 lots, or 16.1%, to 54,260 contracts, while long positions decreased by 40,776 contracts, or 11.1%, to 327,177 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The futures market structure Although the market structure of all three major oil benchmarks – ICE Brent, NYMEX WTI and DME Oman – remained in backwardation, uncertainty about the short-term oil demand outlook, lower seasonal crude demand in Asia, and the prospect of rising global oil supply flattened the backwardation forward curves. Nonetheless, prospects of a supply/demand deficit in 2H21 kept the market structure in backwardation, despite the sharp oil price declines in August.

Brent backwardation eased in August, coming under pressure from abundant crude supply in the Atlantic Basin and the availability of unsold volumes for prompt loading and softer demand, specifically from Asia-Pacific refiners, which pressured the value of nearest month prices. Worries about the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant that threatened to dampen demand also contributed to flattening the futures forward curves. The ICE Brent first-to-third month spread narrowed m-o-m by 40¢, to stand at $1.15/b on average, compared with $1.55/b in July. ICE Brent’s M1/M6 backwardation also eased in August to settle at $2.54/b on average, narrowing 96¢ m-o-m. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements The backwardation forward curve of NYMEX WTI flattened in August despite a large US crude oil stocks decline, including in Cushing, Oklahoma, and refinery throughput remaining about 16.7 mb/d on average in the four weeks of August, according to EIA weekly data. The NYMEX WTI M1/M3 month spread narrowed by 81¢ to a backwardation of 67¢/b on average in August, compared with a backwardation of $1.48/b in July. DME Oman and Dubai structures flattened last month moving into softer backwardation after prompt month prices came under pressure from weaker Asian demand and higher supply availability in the Middle East, in line with DoC decisions. Lower west-to-east arbitrage opportunities and a wide Brent-Dubai spread gave limited support to Dubai-related crude. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1/M3 spread narrowed by 36¢ m-o-m to a backwardation of $1.43/b on average in August. Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread narrowed in August on a monthly average by 59¢ to a backwardation of 96¢/b, compared with $1.55/b in July. In the US, the WTI M1/M3 backwardation narrowed in August by 77¢ to 64¢/b, compared with a backwardation of $1.41b in July. The Dubai M1/M3 backwardation narrowed on average in August by 29¢ to a backwardation of $2.05/b. Crude spreads Sweet/sour crude differentials widened in Europe and the USGC on strong margins of light sweet crudes compared to heavier crudes, and a plentiful supply of sour crude. Strong margins of naphtha and gasoline supported the value of light sweet grades. However, in Asia, the sweet/sour crude differentials narrowed as the sweet crude value fell more than that for sour crude. In Europe, the North Sea Dated-Urals crude Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC differential widened further in August by 76¢ to US$/b average $2.66/b, its highest level this year. The value 8 of medium sour crude Urals remained under pressure 6 on the well-supplied market, amid expectations of 4 higher sour crude supply, including from DoC producers, and soft demand for the grade, particularly 2 in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, the Brent-Dubai 0 exchange of futures for swaps contract (EFS) -2 remained wide in August, although on average the spread rose slightly in August, which makes the Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 arbitrage of Urals to the Asian market unfavourable. Urals crude differentials in August remained in a deep Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals discount to Brent, although the Urals crude LLS-Mars differentials rose m-o-m by 37¢ to a discount of Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. $2.17/b in Northwest Europe, while in the Mediterranean, the Urals crude differentials fell 77¢, on a monthly average, to a discount of $2.67/b. However, the decline in the value of light sweet crude was slower on strong light distillate margins, specifically naphtha and gasoline. In the USGC, the value of sour crude fell significantly in August on the prospect of a higher global supply of sour crude, and the possible sale of 20 mb of sour crude from the US SPR in 4Q21. The LLS-Mars spread widened on 23 August to $3.38/b, its highest level since March 2020. However, supply disruptions in Mexico and worries about the impact of Hurricane Ida on crude production in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the rise of sour crude flows from the USGC to Asia, contributed to limit the decline of Mars sour crude. The LLS premium over medium sour Mars rose on average in August by 5¢ to $2.62/b. In Asia, however, the Tapis premium over Dubai fell last month as domestic light sweet crudes came under more pressure on low demand from regional refiners and became less competitive due to the weak value of similar crude in the Atlantic Basin and a narrower Brent-Dubai spread. The Brent-Dubai spread narrowed by 73¢ m-o-m in August to average $1.43/b. The Asia-Pacific crude oil market also weakened as refinery activity lessened, particularly for Chinese independent refiners, which reduced crude demand. Stronger fuel oil margins in Asia also lent support to heavier crude. The Tapis/Dubai spread narrowed by $1.03 to $4.31/b, while the Dated Brent/Dubai spread narrowed by 51¢ to $2.47/b, from $2.98/b in the previous month. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodity prices were mixed in August. There was a decline in crude oil prices on demand recovery uncertainties related to rising Covid-19 cases, while natural gas and coal prices continued their ascending trend supported by strong demand for power generation amid heatwaves, recovering industrial activities, lower power output from competing energy sources and some supply restrictions due to weatherrelated events. Base metal prices followed a similar pattern as July, easing in the first half of the month on the back of the third consecutive monthly drop in the pace of global manufacturing expansion, and gains in the US dollar value. However, restricted output and a reversal in the dollar appreciation trend at the end of the month provided support. Gold prices declined for the third consecutive month on expectations for faster than anticipated US monetary policy tightening. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index declined m-o-m by 2.1% in August, mainly related to the retreat in crude oil prices over the month. However, natural gas and coal prices rose across all regions. The average index level was up by 69% in the period January–August 2021, compared with the same period in 2020. The non-energy index declined slightly m-o-m by 1%, mainly due to a drop in agricultural commodity prices, but base metals advanced. The non-energy index was up by 36% in the January–August 2021 period, compared to the same months in 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In August, the Henry Hub natural gas price rose by around 11% m-o-m to average $4.1/mmbtu. Prices strengthened at the beginning of the month on expectations of increased demand due to warmer than average weather. Furthermore, towards the end of the month prices rose further on expectations for a drop in Gulf of Mexico production due to the arrival of Hurricane Ida, These factors limited storage gains and resulted in a further widening of the deficit vs. the five-year average. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 20 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 27 August 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 2,871 bcf, around 7.2% below the latest five-year average. At the end of July, stocks were 6.4% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe rose to a record in August, with the average Title Transfer Facility price up by around 23.8% m-o-m to average $15.5/mmbtu. Average prices in the January-August period are around three times higher than the same period last year. The factors described in previous MOMRs continued to support prices, including low inventory levels, restricted supplies from Russia and Norway due to both unplanned outages and scheduled maintenance, strong carbon emission credit pricing that favours natural gas usage by the power sector vs. coal, and favourable Asia LNG differentials vs. Europe that supported export to that region. Limited wind power output has also contributed to greater requirements for thermal power generation. All these factors have contributed to record power prices in Europe. EU inventories ended August around 67% full vs. 57% full at the end of July, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Inventories were approximate 91% full at the end of August last year.

Australian thermal coal prices rose m-o-m by 11.0% in August to average $168.8/mt, approaching the record level from 2008. In the January-August 2021 period, prices have been around 96% higher than in the same period last year. This has been driven by strong demand for power generation in Asia, especially in China, amid warmer than average weather, an expansion in industrial activities, and reduced hydropower generation due to drought. Additionally, reduced coal output from China, amid mine safety reviews, and supply limitations from major exporters, such as Australia, Indonesia, also played a role. In China, thermal power demand rose by 12.7% y-o-y in July, while at the same time coal output dropped by 3.3% y-o-y in July, amid the aforementioned mine safety reviews.. The strong demand for power generation has also translated into higher LNG prices in Asia. The base metal price index rose m-o-m by 1.3% in August. As in the previous month, copper saw a decline, but other group components advanced. However, there were two trends across the month. Base metal prices generally weakened in the first half of August, on the back of evidence of a further deceleration in the expansion of global manufacturing with JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI dropping for the third consecutive month. Further appreciation of the dollar also added pressure. However, as witnessed in July, the trend reversed in the second half of the month on concerns about restricted base metals output from China (especially aluminium) amid power cuts, and the value of the US dollar eased. Average monthly copper prices declined m-o-m in August by 0.9% to average $9,370.1/mt. Average prices in the January-August period were 60.1% higher than in the same period of 2020. Copper stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose to 253,000 at the end of August, from 239,650 tonnes at the end of July suggesting a loosening in market conditions. Furthermore, estimations from the International Copper Study Group (ICGS) saw the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the first five months of 2021 showing a surplus 130,000 tonnes – higher than the previous estimation for the January-April period which showed a 130,000-tonne surplus. Iron ore prices dropped sharply m-o-m by 24% to a monthly average of $162.2/mt. Average prices in the January-August period were 89% higher than the average for the same period last year. Prices weakened as steel making activity dropped in China amid government restrictions. However, steel making activity rose at a global level by 3.3% in July 2021, compared to the same month last year, and by 12.4% in the January–July period, compared to the same period last year. Chinese output declined by 8.4% y-o-y in July – vs. growth of 1.5% y-o-y in June. According to China trade data, iron ore imports declined by 1.7% in the January–August period, compared to the same period last year. In the group of precious metals, gold prices declined on average by 1.2% m-o-m in August, mainly due to declines in the first half of the month when expectations of rising real interest rates in the US firmed. However, it recovered in the second half as expectations for interest rates reversed trend. Meanwhile, silver and platinum prices declined by 6.6% and 7.2%, respectively. 8 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Commodity Markets Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ net length positions decreased across the selected commodities, both in absolute and as share of open interest, Despite that, investors continue to hold a net long position in the selected commodities.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 9 World Economy World Economy Supported by unprecedented government-led stimulus measures and swift improvements in controlling the pandemic in the advanced economies and China, global growth has recovered well. After a healthy recovery in 1H21, global growth momentum has accelerated into 3Q21. Further upside potential may come from additional US fiscal stimulus, ongoing monetary easing and similar support measures in other major economies. At the same time, numerous challenges have become accentuated over the past weeks. With uncertainties in both directions, the global GDP growth forecast remains unchanged for now for both 2021 and 2022 at 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively. The US economic forecast is unchanged at 6.1% for 2021 and 4.1% for 2022. Euro-zone economic growth remains at 4.7% for 2021 and 3.8% for 2022. The forecast for Japan is also unchanged at 2.8% for 2021 and 2.0% in 2022. China’s economy is seen to grow at 8.5% in 2021 and 6% in 2022, in line with the previous month’s assessment. Meanwhile, India’s 2021 growth forecast has been revised down to 9%, following a weaker-than-expected recovery in 2Q21, although growth for 2022 remains unchanged at 6.8%. Given strong growth in 2Q21, Brazil’s growth forecast for this year has been revised up to 4.7% from 4.2%, while growth in 2022 remains unchanged at 2.5%. Russia’s forecast for 2021 has been revised up to 3.5%, benefitting from OPEC-non-OPEC efforts to stabilize the oil market, while the forecast for 2022 remains unchanged at 2.5%. The underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 and 2022 are largely unchanged. This includes, in particular, the assumption that COVID-19 will remain well contained in advanced economies in the sense that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels and the pandemic will also not pose a large obstacle to major emerging economies. While some softening of the 4Q21 growth dynamic has been reflected in the GPD growth forecast, it remains to be seen whether the recent rise in infections in selective major economies will continue, and whether this finally leads to a material softening in consumption. Another challenge is the ongoing global supply-chain issue. Tight labour markets may lead to rising inflation at the global level. Finally, very high debt levels, in both governments and the private sector, could provide substantial challenges going forward.

A rise in COVID-19 cases in the US and other advanced economies has demonstrated that the pandemic is likely to continue. This could even impact economies with high vaccination rates. However, Asian economies, which have relatively lower vaccination coverage among their populations and have so far relied more on usually economically impactful lockdown measures, as seen in past weeks, stand to be hit hardest. As was the case in China in 3Q21, lockdown measures were necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19, negatively impacting economic growth. Another important matter that seems to have become more accentuated is supply-chain issues. In most major economies there is an ongoing mismatch between order backlogs and the ability to fulfil the current magnitude of orders, due to a lack of input goods and inventories. A shortage of semiconductors, among other input goods, has been ongoing. Bottlenecks in logistical capabilities have accentuated this problem. These factors have meanwhile put pressure on prices, lifting inflation. Selective labour market shortages have added to the problem and it remains to be seen if inflation will be a temporary issue. The labour shortage, in combination with once again rising infections, has also dampened the recovery in the services sector. With rising COVID-19 cases, the sectors of travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure may be particularly exposed. As the services sector is an important driver for a fully-fledged economic recovery, it will require close monitoring, including the situation in the US. With ongoing budgetary and debt ceiling negotiations in the US 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Economy Congress, including on additional fiscal stimulus, a softening labour market, and to some extent the ending of COVID-19-related social support systems, along with substantially rising COVID-19 cases, uncertainties have grown. Inflation is a particular subject that will need to be observed, as it has risen across the world over the past months for different reasons. Initial major drivers came via re-opening effects in 1H21 and temporary supply shocks, especially in semi-conductors. It remains to be seen whether temporary supply shocks will be quickly overcome, as supply issues are building up and weather-related events have been lifting food prices. The latest inflation numbers in the US and the Euro-zone show no imminent easing of the situation. A very important driver, global trade continued its Graph 3 1: Global trade rebound, but it may have become constrained by % change y-o-y supply shortages.

Near-term global expectations After a healthy recovery was seen in 1H21, global economic growth has continued to accelerate in 3Q21. However, most recently the combination of rising COVID-19 infections, supply chain issues and growing inflation has led to a slowdown that is forecast to materialize in 4Q21. The underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 and 2022 are so far largely unchanged. This includes, in particular, the assumption that COVID-19 remains well contained in the advanced economies in the sense that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels and that the pandemic will not pose a large obstacle to major emerging economies. With these base assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is forecast to stand at 1.8% q-o-q and decelerate to 0.8% q-o-q in 2Q21. Some acceleration is then forecast to materialize in 2H21, with 3Q21 growth forecast at 1.1% q-o-q and 4Q21 growth at 1.0% q-o-q. The growth pattern in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally spread and in line with average historical patterns. Regarding inflation, it is assumed that it will remain well anchored in the OECD economies in the sense that in 2021 it will not significantly exceed the 2% OECD average on an annual basis and will stand at around 4% in the US. For 2022, these levels are forecast to stand at slightly below 2% for OECD economies on average and around 2.5% for the US. These levels would imply no unexpected interest rate hikes by G4 central banks prior to 2H23. Entering the coming months and hence the northern hemisphere winter season, it will be critical that infection levels not rise too rapidly, especially in those economies where vaccine penetration is still low, as this may coincide with the seasonal flu and the usual arrival of the common cold. Overburdened health facilities may again lead to lockdown measures, negatively impacting affected economies, with consequent spill over effects on the global economy. Such an extended global health challenge would lead to an approximately -2 percentage point (pp) impact on global GDP in 2022. Besides the major issue of COVID-19, supply-chain problems and inflation scares, numerous other localized issues remain, including current fiscal discussions in the US Congress, the outcome of German and Japanese general elections and the potential of rising taxes in various economies amid the build-up of sovereign debt. It also remains to be seen if supply chain issues and the rise in inflation will remain temporary. Labour shortages in select areas, most especially in the services sector, are leading to rising wages, which could have a more sustained effect on inflation. In this regard it will be important to see what the Federal Reserve (the Fed) in particular, as well as the European Central Bank (ECB) will decide in their tapering process. So far it is anticipated that the G4 central banks will continue their accommodative monetary policies. The 2021 and 2022 forecasts have seen selective adjustments in the non-OECD regions. The US economy held its forecast unchanged at 6.1% for 2021 and 4.1% for 2022. Euro-zone economic growth remains at 4.7% for 2021 and 3.8% for 2022. The forecast for Japan is also unchanged at 2.8% for 2021 and 2.0% in 2022. China’s economy is seen to grow at 8.5% in 2021 and 6% in 2022, in line with the previous month’s OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 11 World Economy assessment. Meanwhile, India’s 2021 growth forecast is revised down to 9%, following a weaker-thanexpected recovery in 2Q21, although growth for 2022 remains unchanged at 6.8%. Given strong growth in 2Q21, Brazil’s growth forecast for this year has been revised up to 4.7% from 4.2%, while growth in 2022 remains unchanged at 2.5%. Russia’s forecast for 2021 has been revised up to 3.5%, benefitting from OPEC and non-OPEC efforts to stabilize the oil market, while the forecast for 2022 remains unchanged at 2.5%. Global purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) for Graph 3 2: Global PMI both the manufacturing and services sectors Index retracted slightly in August, reflecting ongoing 60 challenges in supply chains, labour market 58 constraints and rising price levels.

OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments Momentum in the US economy seems to have slowed lately. Job creation in August was less than expected, consumer confidence is falling and rising inflation is eating into household incomes and spending abilities, all leading to a challenging situation for private household consumption. In the meantime, 2Q21 GDP growth was revised up slightly to stand at 6.6% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This compares with the BEA’s assessment last month of 6.5% q-o-q SAAR. Inventory drawdowns dragged growth down in 2Q21 and while this may support 2H21 growth, given ongoing strong underlying demand, current supply-chain issues may dent this dynamic. Consumer confidence retracted substantially to stand at 113.8 in August, compared with 125.1 in July and 128.9 in June, based on the index provided by the Conference Board. Ongoing budget and fiscal stimulus discussions in US Congress in the coming weeks will be important, as there is not only a debt ceiling that may cap US spending abilities if not lifted, but fiscal stimulus may also be needed to counterbalance the ongoing effects of COVID-19. The government would like to provide further fiscal stimulus at a magnitude of possibly $3 trillion or even more over a period of 8 to 10 years. Moreover, 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Economy the Fed continued providing strong support, pointing to a continuation in its accommodative monetary policy, albeit some officials of the of the Fed point at a potential tapering, given the strong rise in consumer prices. US inflation remained high at 5.3% y-o-y in July for a second consecutive month. The strongest appreciation came once again from the sub-sector of transportation, pointing at the possibility of a transitory effect after the reopening of the economy. Prices in the transportation sector rose by 19.1% y-o-y in July. Additionally, the 2020 base was greatly distorted by the effects of pandemic-induced lockdowns. Excluding the volatile components of energy and food, inflation would have stood at 4.2% y-o-y in July. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market compared with 5.4% in July and 5.9% in June. % % 62 10 Non-farm payroll additions slowed considerably in August, increasing by 235,000, after reaching 61.7 1.053 million in July and 962,000 in June.

Hourly earnings rose by 4.3% y-o-y in August, 60 4 compared with 4.1% y-o-y in July, substantially above pre-COVID-19 yearly growth of between 2% and 3%.

Near-term expectations Near-term expectations are almost unchanged, while uncertainties have grown most recently, raising the potential for a downward revision in GDP growth in the coming month if the trend continues. A significant reason behind less-than-strong growth levels in 2Q21 came from a significant inventory draw-down. Given the considerable underlying momentum in the US economy, inventories will very likely be replenished in 2H21. However, supply chains will need to be monitored, as an ongoing shortage of vital input goods like semiconductors could dampen this expectation. While it is assumed that the labour market supply shortage will abate, it remains to be seen if job-seekers are able to enter the job market, considering the latest slowdown in job creation. Positively, further fiscal stimulus may provide an additional upside to the growth forecast. In terms of quarterly growth developments, 1Q21 GDP growth stood at 6.3% q-o-q SAAR and 2Q21 growth was reported at 6.6% q-o-q SAAR, based on BEA numbers. With the expectation of inventory restocking in 2H21 and further stimulus measures, growth levels for 2H21 and 2022 are forecast to remain sound. Growth in 3Q21 is forecast to reach 8.4% q-o-q SAAR, compared with the previous estimate of 8.5% q-o-q SAAR. Growth in 4Q21 is forecast to reach 4.8% q-o-q SAAR, unchanged from last month’s estimate. Quarterly growth in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally distributed. The economy’s service’s sector related slowdown is Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and reflected in August’s PMI levels as provided by the non-manufacturing indices Institute for Supply Management (ISM).

Growth in 2022 is forecast to normalize, but will continue to be very well supported by fiscal stimulus, as well as ongoing accommodative monetary policies. These supporting factors and ongoing momentum are forecast to lift growth to 4.1%, unchanged from the previous month. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, but also supply chain issues and inflation, remain. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments Euro-zone growth performed well in 1H21 and the rising momentum stemming from the reopening of most of the region’s economy carried over into 3Q21, which experienced accelerated momentum in July that will most likely be repeated in August as indicated by most economic indicators. However, the latest rise in infections in some economies highlights that there is ongoing COVID-19-related uncertainty heading into the coming colder months. Moreover, inflation has started to rise and this may lead to a less accommodative monetary policy in the near term. This development is also accentuated by global supply issues that have led to price rises in input goods, which has especially impacted the manufacturing sector in Germany, but as well in France, Italy and Spain. Passenger car production in Germany declined in the three months up to August, when output fell by a substantial 31.7% y-o-y, according to the German car industry association, the Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA). In the meantime, improvements in the labour market and consumption have continued, albeit at a slower pace. The European Central Bank (ECB) has maintained its accommodative monetary policies, but pointed to some tapering in the near-term, taking into consideration rising inflation. Inflation in the Euro-zone reached 3.2% y-o-y in August, up from 2.4% y-o-y in July and 2% y-o-y in June. When excluding the volatile items of food and energy, inflation stood at 1.9% y-o-y in August, up from 1.2% y-o-y in July. Positively, lending to the private sector by monetary financial institutions recovered slightly, rising to 2.6% y-o-y in July from 2.5% y-o-y in June and 2.2% y-o-y in May. However, the largest part of lending activity continues to flow into the real estate sector, while lending to non-financial corporations retracted further and stood at only 0.3% y-o-y in July compared with 0.6% y-o-y in both June and May. The labour market has continued to improve. Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales According to the latest numbers from Eurostat, the % change y-o-y unemployment rate stood at 7.6% in July, comparing 30 with 7.8% y-o-y in June and down from 8% in May. 20 Retail sales in value terms have risen, albeit at a slower pace than in the past months, with growth of 10 4.9 4.9% y-o-y compared with 7% y-o-y in June, both on a seasonally adjusted basis.

And while the base effect Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 needs to be taken into consideration, the slowdown is also very much impacted by current supply issues. Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Economy Near-term expectations The healthy dynamic in 1H21 seems to have carried over into 3Q21, supported by pent-up demand after the end of lockdown measures and an apparent recovery in contact-intensive sectors. The latest indicators show that some of the services momentum may have slowed somewhat due to a recent rise in COVID-19 infections, which highlight the ongoing challenges connected to the pandemic in some parts of the Euro-zone. It remains to be seen whether vaccination rates will achieve sufficient levels towards the autumn and winter to prevent the further spread of new – and apparently more contagious – variants. It is too early to say if the situation is worsening in such a way that it will materially impact consumption and investment, the two main pillars of the recovery. Fiscal stimulus and the ongoing accommodative monetary policy by the ECB are counterbalancing the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. Accordingly, the underlying assumptions for the forecast have not changed. It is anticipated that COVID-19 containment efforts in 2H21 will be effective enough to support the recovery and not derail the economy. GDP growth in 2H21 is forecast to slow on a quarterly basis after reported growth of 1.3% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q21 and 8.2% in 2Q21. GDP growth in 3Q21 is anticipated to reach 7.8% q-o-q SAAR, slightly below the 2Q21 level. In 4Q21, growth is forecast at 3.2% q-o-q SAAR. The August PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs to an ongoing improvement in the manufacturing and Index services sectors, though at a slightly slower pace. The 70 PMI for services, the largest sector in the Euro-zone, 61.4 retracted slightly to 59 from 59.8 in July. The 60 manufacturing PMI retracted only slightly as well to 59.0 stand at 61.4 from 62.8 in July. 50 40 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit and Haver Analytics.

OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Japan’s economy performed better than expected in 2Q21 given the COVID-19-related emergency measures in Tokyo and other areas that were affected by a surge in infections. It also appears that domestic demand performed better than expected in 3Q21, signalling some resilience in the Japanese economy as consumption continues at a good pace despite the emergency measures. The latest mobility indicators, however, point to some negative impact towards the end of August, potentially influenced by the rise in infections. In the meantime, the Prime Minister announced that he would not run again for the leadership of his party, the LDP, and that he would resign by the end of September. Elections will be held in the coming weeks. It was expected that the government would announce new stimulus measures and, while further fiscal stimulus will depend on political developments, further fiscal support may be likely after the elections.

Sources: Ministry of Finance, Japan Tariff Association and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations Japan’s economy is forecast to remain resilient and to benefit from healthy exports and solid domestic demand. Some slowdown in September is anticipated, however, amid the slowing activity in mobility as shown by the latest data. The trend will also very much depend on COVID-19-related developments. Moreover, politics may prove to be influential, given the upcoming general elections in either October or November. In this respect it remains to be seen what further stimulus measures will be undertaken and their magnitude. With the ongoing positive momentum and by taking into consideration the near-term uncertainties, the GDP growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 remain unchanged. The economic situation will be monitored closely over the coming weeks to see which direction the GDP growth dynamic will take. As reported by Japan’s statistical office, 1Q21 GDP declined by 3.7% q-o-q SAAR. Despite the lockdown measures in 2Q21, growth was reported to have recovered and reached 1.3% q-o-q SAAR. This is better than the Secretariat’s expectation of 0.4% q-o-q SAAR for this quarter. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 should then pick up further, with the global economy’s recovery having gained pace in 3Q21. Hence, growth is forecast at 7% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21 before slowing somewhat to reach 5% in 4Q21. However, pandemic-related uncertainties loom large. The impact of ongoing lockdowns is also reflected in Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs the August PMIs, especially in the services sector, Index which remains below the growth-indicating level of 50. 55 The PMI for the services sector, which constitutes around two-thirds of the Japanese economy, 52.7 50 retracted considerably to 42.9 in August, compared with 47.4 in July and 48 in June.

GDP growth is expected to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels next year. GDP growth in 2022 is forecast to slow to 2%, supported by ongoing global growth momentum and stabilising domestic demand. This is also unchanged from the previous month. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s economic recovery slowed considerably in July, reflecting new restrictions that took effect between late July and mid-August to curb with the Delta variant of COVID-19. However, the “zero-tolerance” approach to containing the spread of COVID-19 has slowed new infections, leading to a gradual lifting of restrictions that could stabilize the recovery process. On the consumption side, the recovery has been Graph 3 9: China's industrial production weak and mostly suffered a setback from the re% change y-o-y imposition of stringent restrictions. Indeed retail trade 40 advanced only 8.5% y-o-y in July 2021 following the 12.5% y-o-y gain recorded in the previous month.

External demand momentum continued to build, with China's trade surplus standing at $58.34 billion in August 2021 compared with a surplus of $57.14 billion in the same month of 2020. Exports surged by 25.6% y-o-y to $294.32 billion, while imports jumped 33.1% to $235.98 billion. Nevertheless, the unforeseen growth in external demand might be slowed by global and localized increases in COVID-19 infections. Moreover, global consumption might shift primarily towards service demand, which might result in a drop in external purchases of goods. China’s trade surplus with the US expanded in August to $37.68 billion from $35.43 billion in July. On the policy front, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) recently trimmed the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 pp for most banks, freeing up about 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) of long-term liquidity for the economy, as economic growth began to falter. Nevertheless, this move might not translate into a broader shift towards monetary policy easing given that policymakers are prioritizing the containment of leverage and financial risks. Near-term expectations The slump in economic activity might be highly pronounced in 3Q21. Indeed, the economic recovery was already flattening prior to the recent outbreak. Yet the slowdown in infections, along with progress on vaccinations, might keep support the official growth target of above the 6%. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 17 World Economy The recent PMI indices mirrored the slowdown in Graph 3 10: China’s PMI economic activity in 2H21, which was not only limited Index to manufacturing activity in August but also skipped to 60 services.

The adverse impact of the Delta variant infections during 2Q21 was reflected in the 12.4% q-o-q contraction (seasonally adjusted). So far, the impact of the current wave might be milder compared to the 2020 virus hit. This might be partially due to the less stringent nature of state-level lockdowns. However, the post-2021-lockdown economic recovery might be softer than the recovery that followed the 2020 lockdown.

Source: OPEC. Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments South Africa’s real GDP grew by 19.3% y-o-y in 2Q21, following a contraction of 2.6% y-o-y in the first three months of the year. The economy expanded for the first time following four quarters of contraction. Similar to many other economies, 2Q21 growth was the strongest on record, amid a low base year and helped by the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions. Yet, the recent COVID-19 outbreak combined with July riots, looting and OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 21 World Economy arson may weigh on economic activity, especially in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province and the commercial hub of Gauteng, the largest-contributing provinces to the GDP. Meanwhile, recent data suggest that stress in the labour market has elevated amid a worsening pandemic crisis. According to the latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey, the unemployment rate registered a record high of 34.4% in 2Q21 following 32.6% in 1Q21, while unemployment rose to 32.6% in 1Q21, the highest rate since comparable data started to be released in 2008. The expanded definition of unemployment stood at 44.4%, up from 43.2% in 1Q21. In 2Q21, the youth unemployment rate hit a record high of 64.4%. On a positive note, consumer side inflationary pressure continued to ease as the consumer price index dropped to 4.6% y-o-y from 4.9 in June. The current rate is slightly above the 4.5% midpoint of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range of 3-6%. Part of the greater price pressure is due to last year's low base. The annual core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items such as food and non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and energy, also dropped to 3% y-o-y in July from 3.2% y-o-y in June. In line with expectations, the South Africa Reserve Bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged in July at a record low level of 3.5%. Moreover, the reserve bank revised its CPI forecast for 2021 up to 4.3% from 4.2% and lowered it to 4.2% for 2022 from 4.4%, while keeping it unchanged at 4.5% in 2023. Meanwhile, the official GDP forecast for 2022 and 2023 was set to be 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively, unchanged from the bank’s May forecast. Regarding trade activities, South African exports dropped by 11.2% m-o-m in July, while imports marginally dropped by 0.7% m-o-m in July. As a result, South Africa recorded a R37.0bn merchandise trade surplus, which is way lower than the R54.5bn surplus recorded in June. Near-term expectations In the near term, positive GDP figures and an update of the country’s Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan introduced last year provide positive sentiment. However, recent political instability, along with a new wave of COVID-19 infections and subsequent containment measures, could have a significant impact on the economy in 2H21. However, the gradual lifting of restrictions, along with the external demand boom witnessed earlier in 2021, may keep the recovery on track. Unexpected deadly riots and looting swept parts of the country in July amid a new wave of restrictions, causing the RMB/BER business confidence index in South Africa to fall to 43 in 3Q21 after reaching 50 points in 2Q21. In contrast, the seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index rebounded to 57.9 in August after declining to 43.5 in July.

In August 2021, the IHS non-oil PMI slumped to 54.1 from 55.8 a month earlier, reaching its lowest reading since March. However, as the impact of increasing the value-added tax in July faded out, the annual inflation rate in Saudi Arabia fell to 0.4% y-o-y that month from 6.2% y-o-y in June, registering the lowest inflation rate since December 2019. However, on a monthly basis, consumer inflation edged up 0.2%. Official labour market data suggests that the unemployment rate dropped to 11.7% in 1Q21 from 12.6% in 4Q20. In total, Saudi Arabia’s growth prospects are fundamentally supported by the recovery in oil prices and the government’s stimulus support. However, the development of COVID-19 remains the biggest challenge on the path to full economic recovery. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 23 World Economy Nigeria Nigeria’s economy grew by 5% y-o-y in 2Q21, following expansion of 0.5% y-o-y in 1Q21. This growth was the strongest seen since 4Q14. More importantly, it mirrors a stable economic recovery, as it marked a third quarter of expansion following a recession in 3Q20. Growth was driven by the non-oil sector, which expanded to 6.7% from 0.8% y-o-y in 1Q21. Remarkably, the trade, information and communication, transportation, electricity, agriculture and manufacturing sectors contributed the most to GDP growth. On a quarterly basis, the GDP decreased by 0.8%. For the time being, the re-imposition of lockdown measures to cope with a new wave of COVID-19 has become a more pressing risk. This is reflected in the recent domestic PMI reading, which indicted slower growth in the private sector. The Stanbic IBTC Bank Nigeria PMI slumped to 52.2 in August from 55.4 in July, amid softer increases in non-oil private sector output and new orders. In the short term, the economy is anticipated to pursue its recovery, though high inflationary pressures, liquidity constraints and the impact of and uncertainties related to COVID-19 will provide challenges.

Despite the fact that new COVID-19 cases are edging down, the disruptive Delta variant is becoming more significant in the whole Middle East region, casting a shadow over the economic outlook and threatening the resumption of economic activity. Moreover, with the Dubai Expo 2020 approaching, the Delta variant presents a risk to the number of visitors who can attend, as well as the shadow of re-postponing if the path of infection cases escalates at the regional and global levels. Nevertheless, the overall outlook for the UAE’s economy is still positive, supported by strong credit growth and higher hotel occupancy rates, along with greater mobility following the gradual easing of the latest restriction measures.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 25 World Oil Demand World Oil Demand For 2021, world oil demand is expected to increase by 6.0 mb/d, unchanged from last month’s projections and despite offsetting revisions within the quarters. An upward revision due to positive mobility indicators for OECD countries in 3Q21 was offset by a downward revision to 4Q21, given the risk to oil demand fundamentals stemming from the increase in COVID-19 cases, primarily related to the Delta variant. World oil demand is estimated at 96.7 mb/d in 2021. In 2022, world oil demand is forecast to rise by 4.2 mb/d y-o-y, revised higher by around 0.9 mb/d compared to last month’s report, as the pace of recovery in oil demand is now assumed to be stronger and mostly taking place in 2022. As vaccination rates rise, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be better managed and economic activities and mobility will firmly return to pre-COVID-19 levels. The revisions are based in both the OECD and non-OECD regions, with steady economic developments expected to support the partially delayed recovery in oil demand in various sectors. As a result, the OECD oil demand outlook was revised upward by 0.3 mb/d in 2022 compared to last month’s projection and is projected to increase by 1.8 mb/d y-o-y. In the non-OECD region, oil demand in 2022 is estimated to increase by 2.3 mb/d y-o-y, revised higher by around 0.6 mb/d compared to last month’s estimations, supported by steady economic activities in the main economies, particularly China, India and Other Asia. Additionally, ongoing improvements in vaccination rates and a potential increase in public confidence in managing COVID-19 is anticipated to be more widespread in 2022, further supporting the recovery of oil demand, particularly transportation fuels. World oil demand is estimated at 100.8 mb/d in 2022, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.

OECD OECD Americas Update on the latest developments The latest available oil demand data in OECD Americas imply a y-o-y increase of 3.6 mb/d y-o-y in June, following an increase of 4.3 mb/d y-o-y in May. Gasoline demand accounted for around 27% of the overall increase, with an additional 33% originated in rising jet/kerosene and diesel requirements. On the back of a low historical baseline, June 2021 Graph 4 1: OECD Americas oil demand, y-o-y seems to have recovered approximately 87% of the change losses suffered during the same month in 2020. Oil mb/d demand in the region declined in 1Q21 as a result of rising COVID-19 infection cases before improving 6 thereafter. Gasoline demand in June 2021 posted 4 1.8 substantial gains of 1.0 mb/d y-o-y, rising for the fourth 2 1.1 month in a row and in line with rebounding travel and 0 healthy economic growth. Oil demand continued to -2 remain below June 2019 levels, yet the differential shrank considerably to 0.5 mb/d, as compared to a -4 -3.2 hefty 3.3 mb/d in February 2021. All countries in the -6 region posted solid gains as demand rebounded the -8 most in the US, followed by Canada, Mexico and 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year Chile. 2020 2021* 2022* Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. The latest available US monthly demand data for June shows oil demand rising by approximately 3.0 mb/d y-o-y, making up 96% of the June 2020 losses, but lower than June 2019 by 0.1 mb/d. Gasoline, jet/kerosene and LPG demand accounted for the bulk of the increase, with gasoline gaining 1.0 mb/d y-o-y, while jet/kerosene increased by 0.6 mb/d and LPG by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in June 2021. The declines of gasoline and jet/kerosene in June 2020 were around 1.4 mb/d and 1.0 mb/d y-o-y, respectively. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHA), vehicle miles of travel in the US increased by 15.0% y-o-y in June this year after rising by 31.3% y-o-y in May. In June 2020, the indicator fell by 14.8% y-o-y. Light vehicle retail sales, as reported by Autodata and Haver Analytics, were at 15.4 million units, according to seasonally adjusted annual OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 27 World Oil Demand rates (SAAR), compared with 17.1 million units in May; historical figures show total sales of 13.3 million units in June 2020 and 17.3 million units in June 2019. Industrial production, an indicator for industrial fuel demand, was also higher by 9.9% y-o-y in June after increasing by 16.6% y-o-y in May. Diesel demand was higher by 0.4 mb/d y-o-y in June 2021 following a similar increase in May.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Preliminary data for July based on weekly input indicates the continuation of a recovery in transportation fuel, with both gasoline and jet/kerosene increasing by almost 1.6 mb/d y-o-y collectively. Diesel is foreseen to increase by 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in July 2021. Near-term expectations Despite the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, careful optimism still dominates the short-term demand outlook in the region going into 2022, mainly due to rising vaccination rates. The economy is also expected to be supported by stimulus programmes and high household savings. These factors support a positive outlook for oil demand prospects during 2H21. It should also be noted that the outlook remains challenged by COVID-19 developments, particularly during the emergence of colder weather in 4Q21, and the appearance of new variants and potential government counter-measures. While to date 3Q21 appears to be resilient in terms of travel activity, risks of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour, as well as the effectiveness of vaccination programmes, are to be monitored closely going forward. In 2022, OECD Americas oil demand is forecasted to increase by approximately 1.1 mb/d y-o-y with US oil demand accounting for more than 0.9 mb/d y-o-y, supported by healthy economic growth. Petrochemicals and transportation will be sectors of the economy that will require more oil in 2022. Gasoline demand will be supported by better employment rates and rising vehicle sales, despite continuous penetration of alternativefuelled vehicles. Expansion in the petrochemical industry and consequently healthy petrochemical margins will support light distillates in 2022. Conversely, reduced business travel, a continuation in fuel substitution programmes, and fuel efficiency gains are anticipated to cap oil demand growth. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments OECD Europe oil demand increased by 1.4 mb/d Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y in June, following an increase of more than change 1.6 mb/d y-o-y in May.

Near-term expectations The 3Q21 has proven to be robust so far as vaccination rates improve rapidly and warmer weather favoured efforts to control the pandemic. The current outlook assumes that the pandemic will remain largely under control during 4Q21 with minor localized measures depending on hospitalization capacities. Reduced international travel, teleworking enhancements, and limitations on petroleum product demand will, however, may limit oil demand in the region. In 2022, OECD Europe oil demand is projected to rise by around 0.6 mb/d. Developments in the economy, along with a large containment of COVID-19, are the main assumptions for OECD Europe oil demand growth in 2022, supported by improvements in mobility along with positive developments in the industrial and construction sectors. Downside risks are mostly relate to the appearance of resilient variants, economic uncertainty, including high debt levels and budgetary constraints, in addition stringent policies capping oil usage. OECD Europe oil demand will therefore remain below 2019 levels. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments OECD Asia Pacific oil demand continued to rise in Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y June, increasing by 0.4 mb/d y-o-y, more than the change corresponding 0.2 mb/d increase recorded in May. mb/d Gains were largely attributed to rising light distillate 1.0 requirements in South Korea and Japan, as well as gasoline and diesel demand in Australia and South 0.5 0.2 0.2 Korea.

Sources: JODI, METI and OPEC. Near-term expectations While Japan and South Korea seemed to have brought COVID-19 under control, recently imposed strict lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand are expected to negatively impact oil demand in 3Q21 and 4Q21. Overall demand in 2021 is projected to rebound in the region on the back of a recovery in economic activities. Petrochemical feedstock consumption remains one of the main contributors to oil demand growth in 2021, while jet/kerosene demand is projected to continue lagging 2019 levels, as international business and leisure travel will remain under pressure. In 2022, OECD Asia Pacific oil demand is expected to increase by 0.2 mb/d, under assumptions of expanding GDP and low impact from COVID-19-related challenges on transportation fuel demand. It is anticipated that the pandemic will be controlled in 2022. Gasoline will be the petroleum product category to increase the most, followed by industrial diesel, as well as light distillate petrochemical feedstock. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s oil demand increased by around 0.2 mb/d Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change y-o-y in July compared to a 0.4 mb/d y-o-y increase mb/d in June. Unlike most regions, demand was higher than 2 pre-pandemic levels by 0.7 mb/d compared to July 1.1 2019, primarily driven by strong demand for 1 petrochemical feedstocks, LPG and naphtha. Light 0.7 distillates continued to record steady growth in July on 0 y-o-y basis. LPG grew by more than 0.2 mb/d y-o-y while naphtha posted gains of more than 0.1 mb/d -0.3 y-o-y. The performance of the petrochemical sector -1 has been healthy since 2Q20. Higher utilization rates for Propylene Dehydrogenation Plants (PDH), recent -2 additional PDH capacity and healthy petrochemical 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year margins supported demand for light distillates.

Looking at data from January to July, oil demand showed strong growth of around 1.2 mb/d compared to the same period in 2020. Most of the increase appeared in 1Q21 due to the low base line of 1Q20 amid the onset of COVID-19, which reduced substantially demand for petroleum products. Data for 1Q21 shows an increase of around 1.7 mb/d y-o-y, supported by strong growth in light distillates and recovering transportation fuel demand. Gains were registered across all petroleum products with transportation fuels accounting for the largest share. Gasoline and jet fuel increased by around 0.7 mb/d compared to the same period in 2020, supported by increases in mobility and passenger air travel in contrast to last year. The mobility index improved during the course of the year despite slowing in 1Q21 due to increased measures against COVID-19. On average the index was at 86% of pre-pandemic levels in 1Q21 before reaching to 100% in 2Q21. Light distillates continued to perform strongly throughout the year, particularly LPG, which posted gains of around 0.3 mb/d compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, naphtha demand increased by 0.1 mb/d. 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 6: China’s oil demand*, mb/d Change Jul 21/Jul 20 By product Jul 20 Jul 21 Growth % LPG 2.12 2.36 0.24 11.5 Naphtha 1.84 1.96 0.13 6.9 Gasoline 2.84 3.01 0.17 5.9 Jet/kerosene 0.58 0.49 -0.09 -15.5 Diesel 3.28 2.86 -0.43 -13.0 Fuel oil 0.72 0.86 0.14 19.8 Other products 1.50 1.52 0.02 1.3 Total 12.88 13.06 0.18 1.4 Note: * Apparent oil demand.

Near-term expectations With the government recently enacting measures to counter the spread of the Delta variant, coupled with the slowdown in main macro-economic indicators, oil demand in 3Q21 and marginally in 4Q21 is expected to be negatively affected. However, the overall demand for China in 2021 remained supported and the growth of petroleum products is assumed to be around 1.1 mb/d on annualized basis. The rapid containment of the spread of the Delta variant, the lifting of the fishing ban and the national holidays during the month of October are anticipated to lend support to oil demand in the coming months. The developments around COVID-19 will continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook, but the low-tolerance policy of the Chinese government is projected to speed up the recovery. In 2022, China’s oil demand is anticipated to increase y-o-y, supported by solid economic growth forecasts. Transportation and industrial sectors are projected to rise the most with support coming from an increase in vehicle miles driven, a rise in passenger car sales and a steady industrial sector. Gasoline is estimated to increase followed by diesel. A healthy petrochemical sector is expected to lend strong support to light distillates consumption next year.

Gasoline consumption posted steady gains, rising by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, after showing small gains in June. Demand for gasoline is now on par with pre-pandemic levels and showed a marginal increase when compared to July 2019. Increases in mobility supported by the gradual re-opening of social activities supported gasoline demand. The mobility index was trending above pre-pandemic levels at 106% in July compared to 78% of pre-pandemic levels in June. Data from January to July indicates petroleum products demand rising by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y, led by diesel and gasoline. During the same period in 2020, oil demand posted steep declines of around 0.6 mb/d compared to a year earlier. Weaknesses in transportation fuel due to extended lockdown policies propelled those declines. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 31 World Oil Demand Diesel was higher by a nearly 0.2 mb/d, or by more than 11%, compared to the same period in 2020, but remained significantly lower than the normal consumption levels of 2019 by about 0.2 mb/d. Improvements in industrial and construction activities as well as the agriculture sector supported diesel demand. Of course, the low baseline of 2020 played a major role in this y-o-y increase with support from the overall recovery of economic activities. However, a strong second wave of COVID-19 across the country in May halted the recovery process and consumption fell back into the negative zone.

Generally, industrial production has risen by 127.7% y-o-y from historically low readings in most of 2020, as reported by the Central Statistical Organization of India and Haver Analytics. The easing of lockdown measures and increased use of private vehicles led to improvements in mobility and boosted gasoline demand growth. Gasoline demand grew by 0.1 mb/d when compared to the same period in 2020 and was at par with 2019 levels. Mobility was at 97% of pre-pandemic levels during the analysed period while it was 64% during the same period in 2020. Light distillates, LPG and naphtha marginally increased from January to July compared to the same period last year, supported by steady petrochemical demand and increased LPG demand for home cooking. Near-term expectations Going forward, demand growth is expected to gain momentum in the coming months, supported by the low baseline and recovering diesel requirements in the industrial, construction and agriculture sectors. Transportation fuel demand is projected to be dependent on COVID-19 developments, particularly in 4Q21, and the government containment measures. The oil demand outlook is projected to gain momentum in light of positive policy measures encouraging private consumption and investment, in addition to 2020 baseline decline. Demand for transportation fuel will lead product demand, followed by middle distillates. For 2022, India’s oil demand is expected to rise y-o-y as total consumption exceeds pre-pandemic levels on an annualized basis. COVID-19 containment measures are projected to improve, backed by rising vaccination rates, natural immunity and improved treatment of COVID-19. Economic activity is projected to support demand for refined products, led by transportation fuels, mainly gasoline. Support will be driven by rising mobility and increased use of private vehicles. Diesel will gain strength in 2022, supported by steady developments in the industrial, construction and agriculture sectors. Other Asia Update on the latest developments In Other Asia, January to June data shows demand rising by more than 0.5 mb/d compared to the same period last year. However, demand remained significantly lower, 0.8 mb/d, than pre-pandemic levels mostly due to the slower recovery in transportation fuels. Most of the 0.5 mb/d was driven by rebounding diesel in response to the economic pick-up after 2020. Jet fuel was the only fuel to decline, when compared to the same period last year, mainly due to the second wave of COVID-19 that led to sluggish development in the tourism sector in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. Diesel was higher by more than 0.2 mb/d, but remained lower by 0.1 mb/d compared to the same period in 2019. A slight improvement in trucking activities, construction and agriculture on the back of the uptick in economic activity supported diesel demand. However, the appearance of the Delta variant in some countries in the region led to slower growth during May and July. Naphtha recorded solid growth during the studied period. In fact, naphtha demand exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 0.04 mb/d and was higher in 2021 by more than 0.1 mb/d compared to the same period in 2020. Demand for plastics supported naphtha cracking margins, leading to increased intake rates in naphtha crackers. Gasoline grew by around 0.1 mb/d compared to the same period in 2020, but remained significantly 32 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Oil Demand lower than 2019 by around 0.2 mb/d. After a steady recovery in mobility during 1Q21, movement slowed down in 2Q21 due to imposed measures to contain the second wave of COVID-19 particularly in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand is anticipated to improve y-o-y supported by a positive economic outlook and recovering mobility. The recent prevalence of Delta variant in a number of countries in the regions, however, has imposed downside pressure on the transportation fuel outlook in 4Q21 has affected current data in 3Q21. Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines are anticipated to account for the most of the growth in 2021, led by transportation fuels. In 2022, Other Asia’s oil demand is anticipated to grow and will marginally exceed 2019 levels. Firm economic expectations will provide strong support to demand next year. Transportation fuels are expected to increase amid better management of COVID-19 leading to a healthier outlook for mobility. Latin America Update on the latest developments June data indicates an increase in oil requirements by Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y 0.4 mb/d y-o-y in Latin America, following an increase change of 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in May. However, demand remained mb/d below June 2019 levels by around 0.1 mb/d even 1.0 though industrial fuels, diesel and fuel oil surpassed June 2019 levels. On a y-o-y basis, diesel and 0.5 0.3 gasoline grew the most supported by the harvest 0.2 season and improving transportation momentum. The 0.0 mobility index in the region showed steady gains between May and June, rising from 90% from -0.5 pre-pandemic levels in May to 95% in June. The index -0.6 showed further development in July and August, thus supporting transportation fuel demand. -1.0 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year 2020 2021* 2022* Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. The recovery from the historic decline in 2020 was not full during the course of 2021 in Latin America at least in the 1H21 despite strong diesel performance. Oil demand showed an increase of more than 0.2 mb/d from January to June in contrast with the same period last year, though demand remained below pre-pandemic levels. In terms of products performance, mixed trends were registered. While diesel, gasoline and heavy distillates recorded gains, light distillates – LPG and naphtha – were flat and jet fuel remained lower compared to January to July 2020. In comparison to the same period in 2019, diesel was the only fuel outpacing 2019 levels while LPG and fuel oil were trending at levels similar to 2019. Diesel demand has been very positive in the region, led by Brazil, supported by the agriculture and transportation sectors and the overall recovery in economic activities despite increasing COVID-19 infection cases and high unemployment. Diesel posted gains of more than 0.1 mb/d compared to the same period last year, following a decrease of around similar levels during the same period in 2020. Despite the slow improvement in mobility since the beginning of the year, the region’s mobility index remained lower than 2019. The index stood at 89% of pre-pandemic levels, with gasoline demand rising by around 0.1 mb/d compared to the same period last year. This was mainly impacted by the distorted baseline.

Near-term expectations Oil demand in 2H21 is projected to be supported by rising mobility, although the increase in COVID-19 cases remains a concern. Transportation fuels are projected to gain traction but continue to lag behind 2019 levels. Industrial fuels, diesel and fuel oil are expected be supported by steady economic activities. However, risks are skewed to the downside, particularly due to issues related to COVID-19 cases, political tensions in the region and high unemployment rates. In 2022, Latin America’s oil demand is anticipated to linger below 2019 levels though rise y-o-y. The increase in oil demand will be driven by a healthy economic outlook supporting demand in the region, but mostly in Brazil and Argentina. Transportation fuels are projected to account for most of the gains in 2022, supported by COVID-19 containment measures and overall gains in economic momentum.

Source: OPEC. In Saudi Arabia, oil demand data for July shows a marginal decline after strong gains a month earlier and despite a rise in direct crude consumption in the power generation sector. Diesel and fuel oil led the y-o-y decreases due to slower construction activities and higher crude burning in lieu of fuel oil. According to Yamama Cement Company and Haver Analytics, cement deliveries – a proxy for construction activities – declined by 20.2% y-o-y in July after dropping by 9.9% y-o-y in June. The indicator showed solid gains in July 2020 of around 25.7% y-o-y.

Sources: JODI and OPEC. Data from January to June show solid growth in the Middle East, supported by an increase of around 0.5 mb/d compared to the same period in 2020. All products showed steady growth, propelled by a recovery in economic activities and supported by the construction and industrial sectors, a steady recovery in mobility and the distorted baseline of 2020. Gains were led by a steady recovery in gasoline demand (+0.2 mb/d), diesel (+0.1 mb/d) and petrochemical feedstock, LPG and naphtha, (+0.1 mb/d). Recovering mobility supported gasoline demand in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait with notable increases in 2Q21 largely due to easing lockdown measures across the region and the start of a gradual return of normality. While steady industrial activities supported healthy petrochemical demand and encouraged diesel and light distillates consumption. Near-term expectations The outlook for the remainder of 2021 will depend highly on developments related to COVID-19 and the government response. Currently, the COVID-19 situation is mixed in the Middle East region. On positive side, vaccination rates continue to increase across the region, supporting a return to normal activities. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the partial return to schools and higher education should in turn support demand for transportation fuels. However, the continuing ban on flights from certain locations, such as South Asia, will continue to pose downside risks to demand going forward. In 2022, demand is assumed to continue to recover as economic activities accelerate. The construction and industrial sectors are assumed to lend support to demand. However, the pace of the recovery will depend on challenges related to COVID-19, the potential development of new variants, and the rate as well as the effectiveness of vaccinations. That said, Middle East oil demand growth is anticipated to gain further strength in 2022 due to continued economic growth. As a result, transportation fuel, light distillates for petrochemical usage, and construction fuels are expected to be the products leading oil demand growth next year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 35 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 (including processing gains) was revised down by 0.17 mb/d from the previous assessment, owing to a downward revision of 0.52 mb/d in 3Q21. The revisions are mainly due to oil production outages in North America in August, related to Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and an explosion and fire on an offshore platform in Mexico. Production estimates in the North Sea were also revised down, due to lower-than-expected output in 3Q21. Annual growth is now forecast at 0.9 mb/d y-o-y, to reach 63.8 mb/d. The US liquids supply forecast has been revised down by 41 tb/d and is forecast to grow by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y. The downward revision due to disruptions in production caused by Hurricane Ida was partially offset by higher-than-expected output in 2Q21. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, Russia, China, the US, Brazil and Norway, while output is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Indonesia and Egypt. The non-OPEC supply growth forecast for 2022 is unchanged at 2.9 mb/d, amid offsetting revisions, to average 66.8 mb/d (including a recovery of 0.11 mb/d in processing gains). Including the expected growth of OPEC NGLs, liquids supply is forecast to grow by 3.1 mb/d. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are Russia (1.0 mb/d) and the US (0.78 mb/d), followed by Brazil, Norway, Canada, Kazakhstan, Guyana and other non-OPEC countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC). Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding the financial and operational aspects of US production remains high. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 is estimated to grow by 0.12 mb/d to average 5.17 mb/d. For 2022, it is forecast to grow by 0.13 mb/d to average 5.29 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in August increased by 0.15 mb/d m-o-m to average 26.76 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids production in August, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have declined by 0.2 mb/d m-o-m to average 68.9 mb/d, up by 2.36 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply increased by 0.03 mb/d m-o-m to average 95.69 mb/d, up by 4.93 mb/d y-o-y.

This is almost the same level of average liquids supply in 2019, assuming the current pace of drilling and well completion in oil fields continues up to 3Q22, with possible higher spending in the prolific Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Bakken shale sites. Operational activities in 4Q22 are likely to improve compared to the first three quarters. It is worth noting that the EIA has upwardly revised its oil supply figures in 2019 and 2020 by 0.03 mb/d and 0.01 mb/d respectively, to average 1.81 mb/d and -0.86 mb/d. 40 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Oil Supply With reported well production data for June 2021 provided by the EIA, US crude oil production in 2021 is expected to decline by 0.08 mb/d to average 11.21 mb/d, revised down by 0.04 mb/d m-o-m. The downward change in the GoM oil supply forecast by 0.04 mb/d led to this revision. Oil supply in the GoM is now expected to grow by 0.09 mb/d to average 1.74 mb/d. At the same time, the US tight crude and conventional crude oil forecast is updated to account for the latest production and activity trends, along with the early communication on 2022 capital plans provided in the 2Q21 earnings season. US crude oil production is expected to exit December at 11.54 mb/d (as of September 2021), although production might again be affected negatively in October, as was seen in 2020. US tight crude and conventional crude oil is forecast to see a contraction of 0.09 mb/d each to average 7.20 mb/d and 2.24 mb/d, respectively.

On 31 August, the Norwegian government proposed a revamp of the country’s petroleum fiscal regime. The changes are primarily related to how the petroleum tax is calculated, and the new system tries to be more cash-flow based. This measure could lower the breakeven price for new projects, while the removal of cashback on exploration expenses would hit companies that focus mainly on exploration, according to Rystad Energy. 44 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 World Oil Supply For 2021, Norway’s growth forecast has been revised Graph 5 20: Norway’s monthly liquids production down by 28 tb/d m-o-m due to lower output in 2Q21 development and forecast revision for 3Q21.

For 2021, liquids production has been revised down by 14 tb/d m-o-m and is projected to grow by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.17 mb/d. Oil production in Brazil, Guyana, Ecuador, Argentina and Peru is forecast to increase, while declines are expected in Colombia and other countries in the region. Production in Colombia recovered in July to average 0.75 mb/d, as the national strike and protests had ended. Crude oil production had been affected through May and June. For 2022, Latin America’s total liquids supply forecast is projected to grow by 0.33 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.50 mb/d. One of the key drivers is Brazil, with expected growth of 0.23 mb/d, including biofuels, to average 3.97 mb/d. Guyana would be the second country in the region experiencing growth next year, with output rising by 0.09 mb/d, through the start-up of Liza Phase 2, which remains on target for early 2022. Oil production in other countries in the region will decline, or see only minor growth. Brazil Brazil’s crude output rose by 0.14 mb/d m-o-m to average 3.05 mb/d in July as unplanned maintenance and COVID-19 related outages eased, but is lower by 33 tb/d, y-o-y. Another reason for rising production was production reaching maximum capacity at P-70 FPSO, which is located in the Atapu field in the Santos Basin. Production started in the Sepia field in the Santos Basin on 23 August, expanding production capacity by 0.18 mb/d at the Carioca FPSO. Therefore, total oil supply in 3Q21 is expected to be higher than 2Q21, even if production was halted for a while for maintenance in other fields. In July, total liquids production was pegged at an average of 3.75 mb/d, including biofuels and NGLs, up by 0.15 mb/d m-o-m, but lower by 0.08 mb/d, y-o-y. Brazilian liquids supply in 2021, including biofuels, is forecast to grow by 0.07 mb/d y-o-y, to an average 3.74 mb/d, revised down by 11 tb/d in this month. For 2022, Brazil’s liquids supply forecast, including biofuels, is set to increase by 0.23 mb/d y-o-y to average 3.97 mb/d. Crude oil production is expected to rise through two new project start-ups: Mero-1 (Guanabara), which was initially planned to start up in 2021; and Peregrino-Phase 2.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Product Markets and Refinery Operations In August, refinery margins continued to trend upwards globally, showing substantial gains particularly in the Atlantic Basin, supported by seasonal strength in transport fuels. Meanwhile, COVID-related mobility restrictions remained relaxed and in most of the world’s largest-consuming countries recovered to postpandemic highs. In the US, a reduction in total product inventory levels, as well as strong exports, supported product markets in the country amid seasonal support and drove gasoline margins to new record highs. In Europe, refining margins benefitted from positive performance all across the barrel, while a contraction in fuel output from key traditional fuel suppliers within the region helped strengthen European product markets. Meanwhile in Asia, positive performance in the jet/kerosene and fuel oil markets, driven by a boost in summerrelated air travel and cooling requirements, pushed regional refining economics to post slight gains. Refinery margins US Gulf Coast (USGC) refining margins extended Graph 6 1: Refining margins gains witnessed the previous month, surging to a US$/b post-pandemic record high of $15.48/b. This robust 16 performance was attributed to all sections of the barrel, as solid gains in product crack spreads were 12 nearly equally distributed across the barrel. At the 8 same time, US refinery intakes in August increased only moderately by 40 tb/d, which sustained US 4 product markets by preventing an upturn in product surplus. Pressure on refinery intakes was also partly 0 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 induced by weather-related refinery shutdowns in late August, as Hurricane Ida hit northeast US on August 2, causing power outages and damage. The impact of WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) resulting capacity losses are expected to be extensive Oman (Singapore) in the coming month, though they also weighed Sources: Argus and OPEC. considerably on current monthly intake figures, contributing further to tighter product margins for WTI, which averaged $15.48/b in August, up by $3.08/b m-o-m and $10.18/b y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe rose in response to stronger product fundamentals, with all products across the barrel showing solid gains, while gasoline margins were clearly the leading driver for this upside. The robust performance in European gasoline was a result of declining gasoline supplies from Russia, along with significant declines in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage hub gasoline inventory levels, which fell to their lowest point since 2016, down 50% relative to the previous year, according to Argus. Higher gasoline imports from Germany due to floods provided further support to gasoline markets. Moreover, toll road usage in Spain, Italy, Poland and France was reported higher compared with levels seen around the same time in 2019, with August 2021 representing a very optimistic month in terms of European gasoline requirements. European refinery run rates in August increased slightly, up by 150 tb/d m-o-m according to preliminary data. Nevertheless, the combination of eased mobility restrictions and summer season support outweighed the negative impact of a slight rise in product output. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $1.57/b in July, up by 71<U+023C> compared with a month earlier and 27¢ y-o-y. In Asia, margins showed the mildest gains relative to the other regions, supported by low fuel exports from China, which kept product supplies from China to the rest of Asia very limited and helped cap a product surplus, ultimately lifting jet fuel and fuel oil crack spreads. In addition, a strong recovery in fuel sales in India, despite a rise in new Delta variant COVID cases in that region, provided further support. Asian refinery run rates in August rose, up by 400 tb/d m-o-m according to preliminary data, which at the same time represented the largest m-o-m intake rise compared with the other main regions. This, coupled with poor mobility data for Southeast Asia, may have adversely impacted product markets within the region, limiting the positive performance of Asian refining economics registered in August. In the OECD Asia Pacific, refiners in Japan increased intake in August (+0.45 mb/d m-o-m) to 2.93 mb/d, which is the highest level since January 2020. The Summer Olympics, which took place in Tokyo between end of July and the first half of August, likely had an influence. An announcement was made to permanently shut down the 107 tb/d Marsden Point refinery and 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations only use the facility as an oil product import terminal starting in mid-2022. This is one of many refineries in the OECD Asia Pacific region over the past few years to face this fate, as regional refiners are exposed to mounting competition from high-complexity, newly built refineries in the non-OECD Asia Pacific region (e.g. China, India, Brunei and the Middle East). Once the permanent shutdown is executed, New Zealand will no longer have any of its own refining capacity and will rely solely on product imports to meet domestic demand. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia gained 98¢ m-o-m to average $1.97/b in August, which was higher by 72<U+023C> y-o-y. Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased moderately in Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates August to average 91.53%, which corresponds to a % throughput of 16.59 mb/d. This represented a rise of 100 1.1 pp and 160 tb/d, respectively, compared with the 90 previous month.

Product markets US market US gasoline crack spreads continued to trend Graph 6 3: US Gulf crack spread vs. WTI upwards to reach the highest level registered since US$/b July 2019. Support came from strong inventory 30 drawdowns amid positive seasonal support, while 20 mobility indicators remained supportive and backed gasoline markets.

USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads rose, as summer-season-related support continued to lend backing to markets, while jet fuel production rates remained nearly unchanged m-o-m, keeping jet fuel balances tight. The ongoing recovery in domestic flight activity was firm, although the international travel segment remains under pressure, exacerbated by the spread of the new Delta COVID variant, before naturally losing steam as the summer season comes to an end. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $9.25/b, up by $2.05 m-o-m and $4.23 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI reversed course relative to the previous month, recovering due to stronger fundamentals, while a shift to higher, light-end yields by US refiners helped sustain US diesel markets. Over the month, the gasoil inventory showed significant draws, triggering positive market sentiment. Relaxed lockdown restrictions in Europe likely attracted additional export volumes out of the US and provided support to US gasoil markets. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $4.85/b, down by $2.25 m-o-m and by $2.82 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 53 Product Markets and Refinery Operations US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI strengthened further, sustained by favourable conversion economics that encouraged refiners to maximize fuel oil processing rates in secondary units, given supportive coker margins. Going forward, the start of autumn peak maintenance season should support fuel oil markets as traders efforts to balance fuel supplies between the various regions are expected to boost bunker activity. This should limit the fuel oil downturn in the near term. In August, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $4.99/b, higher by $2.03 m-o-m, but down by $4.11 y-o-y. European market Gasoline crack spreads showed remarkable Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent strength, soaring to reach post-pandemic record highs US$/b in line with an uptick in automotive fuel consumption 20 levels due to a rise in holiday road trips.

The gasoline crack spread against Brent averaged $19.94/b in August, up by $3.85 m-o-m and $11.32 y-o-y. Jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent reversed trend, recovering from the previous month’s losses, backed by an improvement in fundamentals. A boost in holiday travel over the month, amid tighter balance within the region, sustained jet fuel markets despite Europe’s air traffic still being down 30% from 2019 levels, as international and business air travel remained somewhat supressed. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $5.79/b, up by $1.52 m-o-m and $5.98 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads rebounded as well, supported in Europe by strong regional industrial activity amid resilient demand. European gasoil prices stepped down to $77.67 from a post-pandemic record high $80.29 registered the previous month, in line with a m-o-m reduction in crude price. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $6.87/b, which was higher by $1.58 m-o-m and $1.96 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads improved, in line with robust exports to outside the region. Robust requirements from Asia Pacific amid tight domestic supplies provided support. In addition, the current strength in gasoline cracks continued to help conversion margins, which further encouraged refiners to convert fuel oil in secondary units. At the same time, an ongoing pick-up in fuel oil exports to fulfil higher power generation requirements going forward should keep the balance tight and lend support to fuel oil markets in the near term. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $2.33/b in August, having gained $1.56 m-o-m and $1.29 y-o-y. 54 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Asian market The Asian gasoline 92 crack spread lost some Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai ground, affected by high COVID variant cases in US$/b Southeast Asia as the extension of restriction 15 measures exerted pressure on mobility figures across 10 OECD Asia.

The cracker had to Sources: Argus and OPEC. be shut due to a fire on August 16, which delayed the resumption of operations to late August. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged $1.64/b, having decreased by $1.10 m-o-m, but up by $5.11 y-o-y. In the middle of the barrel, jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia strengthened, supported by lower supplies from China amid firm regional requirements for domestic air travel, mainly in China. The majority of international flights remained suspended due to prolonged border restrictions amid outbreaks of the new COVID variant in many parts of Asia, while business travel was still being avoided as much as possible. This likely capped gains in jet/kerosene margins. In the near term, high cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant in Asia could maintain international border restrictions, pointing to downside risks in regional jet fuel crack spreads in the coming month. However, firmer demand from the faster-recovering aviation sector in the West could provide some support to the regional jet fuel market, amid expected improvement towards the end of the year, as the vaccinated share of the population grows and seasonal heating demand for kerosene picks up. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged minus $4.68/b, slightly up by 26<U+023C> m-o-m and $4.66 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread moved lower on weaker industrial demand, while the rise in Delta variant infection rates showed a clear negative impact on the fuel’s consumption levels, linked to the transportation sector in the region. Over the month, several countries in the region reported a high number of COVID-19 cases, with Malaysia reaching more than 1 million infections. The virulent Delta variant has turned Southeast Asia into the global epicentre of the virus. Restrictions on gasoil exports from China, if sustained, could provide some support to the market in the near term. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $4.40/b, down by 70<U+023C>/b m-o-m and $3.12 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spread ended the downward trend witnessed since the start of the year to post much-needed gains in August, although it remained deep in negative territory. This was partly attributed to tightening fuel oil balance in the region, while fuel oil prices surged in Asia as some power generators sought alternatives after the cost of LNG skyrocketed. Demand from utilities, primarily in Pakistan and Bangladesh, has led to fuel oil prices almost doubling from a year earlier on a gas equivalent basis, according to secondary sources, which likely boosted fuel oil crack spreads. The expected seasonal rise in refinery outages globally should boost bunkering activities, as traders seek to rebalance product volumes between the various regions, supporting fuel oil markets in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $7.04/b, up by $2.26 m-o-m but down $7.94 y-o-y.

Sources: Argus and OPEC. 58 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Tanker Market Tanker Market VLCC tanker rates remained at depressed levels in August, weighed down by ample tonnage availability and a lagging increase in tanker demand. Suezmax and Aframax rates managed a better performance in intra-Asian routes, as well as the Atlantic Basin, particularly from West Africa to the US Gulf Coast. Clean tanker rates showed a healthy improvement East of Suez but slipped in the West. The arrival of Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the month resulted in temporary dislocations, temporarily lending some support to dirty Aframax rates, while depressing clean rates in the early days of September as Gulf Coast refineries remain offline. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in August, falling by 0.8 mb/d, or around 6%, to average 13.9 mb/d. Declines came as activity in Asia was muted and buying slowed in Europe. Compared to the previous year, spot fixtures were lower, falling by just under 2%. It should be noted that rates began the current low phase in June 2020 and have remained relatively flat since; therefore, the August 2020 figures reflect this downturn.

OPEC spot fixtures also declined m-o-m in August, falling by almost 0.6 mb/d, or around 5%, to average 9.85 m/b. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were about 4% higher, rising by 0.4 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East averaged 6.2 mb/d in August, broadly in line with the previous month, amid steady flows from the region to much of Asia with the exception of China. Y-o-y, the route saw an increase of 0.5 mb/d, or around 9%. Middle East-to-West fixtures declined by 6% m-o-m to average 820 tb/d, amid lower flows to Northwest Europe (NWE) and most of the Mediterranean. This was a decline of around 0.2 mb/d, or almost 23%, compared to the same month last year. Outside the Middle East, fixtures declined 0.5 mb/d, or 15% m-o-m, to average 2.85 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were 4%, or around 0.1 mb/d higher. Sailings and arrivals OPEC sailings increased m-o-m in August, gaining almost 1.3 mb/d, or around 6%, to average 22.37 mb/d. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings were 2.2 mb/d, or about 11% higher than the very low levels seen in August 2020. Middle East sailings showed further m-o-m gains in August, rising 0.8 mb/d, or 5%, to average 16.5 mb/d. Y-o-y, sailings from the region rose 1.8 mb/d, or about 13%, compared with the same month last year. Crude arrivals in August were higher m-o-m on all routes. Arrivals in North America averaged 9.1 mb/d, representing a gain of 0.4 mb/d m-o-m, or close to 5%, and a 1.2 mb/d, or around 16% increase y-o-y.

Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates slipped lower in August, falling 3%, with marginal weakness exhibited across major routes. Y-o-y, VLCC rates fell 7% due to the stronger performance of West Africa last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-East route were unchanged from the previous month, averaging WS31 points amid stable activity at weak levels as tanker demand remained insufficient to substantially reduce the tonnage imbalance to support rates. Y-o-y, rates were 3% lower. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route declined for the second month in a row, dropping 5% in August to stand at WS21 points amid lower flows to Europe despite steady flows to the United States. Y-o-y, rates were 5% lower. The West Africa-to-East route also declined, down 3% m-o-m in August to average WS33 amid some supply setbacks in the region. Rates were 11% lower compared with August 2020.

Clean tanker freight rates Average clean spot freight rates in August rebounded after three months of losses, increasing 14% m-o-m. the increase was driven by East of Suez rates, which enjoyed strong gains due to rising demand and reduced tonnage availability, with spot rates rising on average 49% m-o-m and 61% y-o-y. In contrast, West of Suez rates declined 2% on average in August, as the tanker market in the region was weak due to ample tonnage supply amid slow demand.

However, rates were 21% higher compared with the same month last year. Rates on the Cross-Med and Med-to-NWE routes declined by around 3% each to average WS116 and WS125 points, respectively. Y-o-y, rates were 41% higher on the Cross-Med route and up by 36% on the Medto-NWE route. The arrival of Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the month resulted in temporary dislocations, depressing clean rates in the early days of September as Gulf Coast refineries have been slow to restart. 62 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports declined for the second month in a row but remained at a strong 6.3 mb/d in August. US crude exports averaged just under 3.0 mb/d in August, after falling to 2.7 mb/d the month before, amid renewed interest by Indian buyers. US product imports rose m-o-m to a robust 2.6 mb/d, while product exports slipped for a second month to average a still healthy 5.3 mb/d. With the US Gulf region hit hard by Hurricane Ida, crude and product exports, and to a lesser extent crude imports, are likely to be impacted in September. China’s crude imports have remained relatively flat since April, averaging 9.7 mb/d in July, amid lower imports from independent refineries as well as port disruptions due to storms. Product imports in July also fell back from the previous month’s levels, while product exports declined to a 10-month low, averaging 1.2 mb/d, as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel outflows plunged. Preliminary data for August shows China’s crude imports rebounding to 10.49 mb/d and a further decline in product exports, amid what seems to be an emerging government policy of limiting excess refinery activity. India’s crude imports continued to decline m-o-m in July, reaching a 12-month low of 3.6 mb/d amid unplanned outages and limited refinery runs. Product imports edged higher, led by a strong jump in fuel oil, which offset declines in naphtha and kerosene. Product exports fell for the second month in a row, with declines across most major products except fuel oil. With state-owned refiners are looking to increase runs to maximum capacity in the coming months, crude imports are expected to turn higher in the coming months, potentially leaving July figures as the lowest for this year. Japan’s crude imports recovered from the historically weak performance seen the month before to average 2.1 mb/d in July, as the Tokyo Olympics held 23 July-8 August provided limited support due to COVID-19 safeguards. Product imports, including LPG, were broadly unchanged m-o-m at 0.9 mb/d, while product exports continued to show strong m-o-m gains, due to higher outflows of jet fuel and gasoil. With the state of emergency extended until the end of September, crude imports are likely to remain relatively flat and the timing of any recovery toward pre-COVID levels remains uncertain. The latest data shows OECD Europe crude imports hit a 14-month high in May, averaging 8.6 mb/d, amid higher inflows from the US and Nigeria. Crude exports fell sharply to the lowest since October 2019, averaging 0.3 mb/d in May, amid reduced flows to Asia. More recent data shows crude imports strengthening slightly in July and August. OECD crude exports are expected to remain weak over the same period, with reports of increased Asia buying of North Sea grades only in September. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports declined for the second month in a row in August but remained at a strong 6.3 mb/d. Crude inflows were 0.2 mb/d or 3% lower m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, crude imports were 0.9 mb/d, or more than 16%, higher. US crude exports averaged just under 3.0 mb/d in August, after falling to 2.7 mb/d the month before, amid renewed buying interest from India. Compared with the same month last year, crude exports were around 0.4 mb/d lower, representing a decline of 12%.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 63 Crude and Refined Products Trade The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination for June shows a rise in exports to Asia. India was the leading destination for US crude exports that month, with 520 tb/d, followed by South Korea with 460 tb/d. This represented a six-month high for India and a seventeen-month high for South Korea. Canada came third with 310 tb/d. Flows to key European destinations were steady to lower, with the Netherlands at 220 tb/d and the UK at 200 tb/d. US net crude imports averaged 3.3 mb/d in August, compared with 3.8 mb/d the month before and 2.0 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US imports rose m-o-m to a robust 2.6 mb/d in August, supported by higher flows from South Korea. This represents a m-o-m increase of less than 0.1 mb/d or nearly 4%. Y-o-y, product imports were almost 0.6 mb/d, or 27%, higher. US product exports fell further in August, averaging 5.3 mb/d, as lower demand from Latin America offset higher flows to Asia. Product outflows declined by 4%, or around 0.3 mb/d m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, product exports were close to 0.2 mb/d, or 4%, higher As a result, US net product exports averaged around 2.7 mb/d in August, compared with 3.1 mb/d in the previous month and 3.1 mb/d in the same month last year.

This compares with net imports of 0.7 mb/d the month before and net exports of 1.1 mb/d in August 2020. Looking ahead, crude and product exports – and to a lesser extent crude imports – are likely to be impacted in September by disruptions from Hurricane Ida, which struck the US Gulf Coast around the end of August. While the region has a track record of resilience, the recovery has been atypically slow so far. While operations at the LOOP terminal have been affected, the key crude export ports of Houston and Corpus Christi were well away from the path of the storm. Product imports are likely to increase, particularly flows from Europe to the Atlantic coast, to make up for the shortfall in domestic supplies as power outages have slowed the restart of refinery capacity. China China’s crude imports averaged 9.7 mb/d in July to remain relatively flat since April. A number of factors have limited crude imports since the start of 2Q21. By that time, independent refiners had depleted crude import quotas and failed to receive any further allotments. Additionally, the government initiated efforts to strengthen oversight in the refining sector, including closing tax loopholes on feedstocks and halting crude quota irregularities, while rising crude prices further encouraged state-owned refiners to draw on the high commercial inventories built up over the previous year. In July, renewed lockdown measures to combat the inland spread of the Delta variant added uncertainty to the demand outlook and the Typhoon In-fa – the second-wettest tropical cyclone on record – temporarily disrupted key port operations. However, recently released preliminary data for August shows potential signs of a turnaround, as China’s crude imports for that month rebounded to 10.49 mb/d. The recovery in crude imports in August reflects the lifting of the temporary factors mentioned above, as well as a possible resolution of some of the oversight issues. Developments such as the reported receipt of import quotas by some independents, reduced destocking by state refiners, the end of disruptions from the typhoon, and improving domestic demand amid easing lockdown measures ahead of the Golden Week holiday in October have all contributed to the surprisingly strong showing in August. It remains to be seen whether this rebound can be sustained, as the August figures have been somewhat boosted by delayed inflows from July. However, based on current expectations, crude imports should have a good performance in 4Q21, potentially pushing 2021 to the second highest year on record in terms of crude imports. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia and Russia were virtually tied for the top position in July, with shares of just over 16%. Iraq was third with 11%, followed by Kuwait with 10% and Oman with 9%. 64 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Graph 8 3: China’s import of crude and Graph 8 4: China’s export of total products total products mb/d mb/d mb/d 2.0 13 2.0 1.5 12 1.5 11 1.0 10 1.0 0.5 9 0.5 0.0 8 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 0.0 LPG Fuel Oil Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Naphtha Jet Fuel Gasoil Gasoline Gasoil Gasoline Jet fuel Fuel oil Others Crude (RHS) LPG Naphtha Others Sources: China, Oil and Gas Petrochemicals and OPEC.

In terms of products, imports also fell back from previous month’s levels, declining 0.1 mb/d or 7% m-o-m to average 1.5 mb/d in July, with strong declines in LPG and jet fuel. However, inflows were supported by fuel oil, which reached a 13-month high. Compared to the same month last year, China’s product imports were almost 0.3 mb/d or 28% higher. Product exports fell to a 10-month low in July, averaging around 1.2 mb/d, as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel outflows plunged. Y-o-y, product exports increased 0.3 mb/d or 37%.

As a result, China returned again to being a net product importer in July, with net product imports averaging 0.3 mb/d, compared with net exports of 94 tb/d the month before and net product imports of 0.3 mb/d in the same month last year. Preliminary data shows product imports rising m-o-m in August to mark a 14-month high, while product exports declined over the same period to stand at a 12-month low, indicating strengthening domestic consumption and providing a supportive market signal going forward. India India’s crude imports continued to decline m-o-m in July, reaching a 12-month low of 3.6 mb/d amid unplanned outages and limited refinery runs. Crude inflows have generally fallen since hitting a high of 4.8 mb/d in December of last year. The only exception has been April when inflows briefly rose to 4.5 mb/d, before the spread of the Delta variant triggered renewed lockdown measures. Compared with the previous month, crude imports in July declined by 0.3 mb/d, or almost 9%. However, imports were still more than 0.6 mb/d, or almost 22% higher, than the multi-year low seen in July 2020, when inflows briefly dropped below 3.0 mb/d. In terms of crude imports by source, the latest data for May show Iraq retaining the top position with a share of 22%. Saudi Arabia was second with around 16%, followed by the UAE with almost 13%. The US was fourth with around 9%. For products, imports edged higher, rising 2% m-o-m to average 1.0 mb/d, led by a strong jump in fuel oil, which offset declines in naphtha and kerosene. Compared with the same month last year, India’s product imports slipped marginally by less than 1%. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – September 2021 65 Crude and Refined Products Trade Product exports in July fell for the second month in a row to average 1.2 mb/d, with declines across most major products except fuel oil. Product outflows declined 0.3 mb/d or 18% m-o-m but were 0.2 mb/d or 19% higher y-o-y.

Looking ahead, state-owned refiners have plans to increase runs to maximum capacity in the coming months, supporting crude imports. According to estimates by Vortexa, India’s crude imports already returned above 4.0 mb/d in August. While concerns remain regarding a third wave of COVID-19, signs that driving activity is picking up signals a renewal of activities ahead of the festive season in September and the onset of the planting season for the winter harvest, which could result in higher product imports and reduced outflows for the remaining months of the year.

Saudi Arabia came second, with a share of 35%, followed by Kuwait and Qatar, with 11% and 9% respectively. Product imports were broadly unchanged m-o-m in July at 0.9 mb/d, with declines in gasoline and naphtha offset by increases in fuel oil and LPG. Compared with the same month last year, product imports rose by around 1%. Product exports continued to show strong m-o-m gains, increasing 11% to average 0.4 mb/d, with higher outflows of jet fuel and gasoil.

Looking ahead, the extension of the state of emergency until the end of September is likely to keep crude imports relatively flat and the timing of any recovery toward pre-COVID levels remains uncertain. OECD Europe The most recent official data shows OECD Europe crude imports hit a 14-month high in May, averaging 8.6 mb/d, amid higher flows from the US and Nigeria. This represents an 8% increase m-o-m. Gains were driven by expectations of a recovery in consumption with the easing of lockdown measures. Y-o-y, crude inflows rose 0.8 mb/d, or close to 10%. Crude exports fell sharply in May to the lowest since October 2019, averaging 0.3 mb/d, representing a decline of 0.2 mb/d or almost 48%. Declines came amid a continued slowdown in buying from Asia. Compared with the same period last year, crude exports were also around 0.2 mb/d, or 45%, lower. As a result, net crude imports averaged 8.3 mb/d in May, up from 7.4 mb/d the month before and the 7.3 mb/d recorded in the same month of 2020.
