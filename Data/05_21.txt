Similarly, the OPEC Reference Basket price declined $1.32, or 2.0%, in April, to settle at $63.24/b. However, year-to-date, the ORB was 41.6%, or $17.91, higher than the same period in 2020 at $60.97/b. Crude oil futures prices fell on both sides of the Atlantic, with the ICE Brent front month down 37¢, or 0.6%, to average $65.33/b, and NYMEX WTI front month fell by 65¢, or 1.0%, to average $61.70/b. Consequently, the Brent-WTI spread widened in April to an average of $3.62/b. The backwardation structure of all three major oil futures benchmarks lessened across the month. Hedge funds and other money managers slightly raised long positions in crude, recovering part of their net long positions from the sell-off seen in March, with gains concentrated mainly in Brent. World Economy Stimulus measures in the US and accelerating recovery in Asian economies are expected to continue supporting the global economic growth forecast for 2021, now revised up by 0.1 pp to reach 5.5% y-o-y. This comes after a 3.5% y-o-y contraction estimated for the global economy in 2020. However, global economic growth for 2021 remains clouded by uncertainties including, but not limited to, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the speed of the global vaccine rollout. In addition, sovereign debt levels in many regions, inflationary pressures and central bank responses are key factors to monitor. After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, US economic growth in 2021 is now expected to reach 6.2%. The economic growth forecast for the Euro-zone in 2021 is lowered to stand at 4.2%, following a contraction of 6.8% last year. Similarly, Japan’s economic growth forecast is lowered to 3.0% for 2021, following a contraction of 4.9% in 2020. After growth of 2.3% in 2020, China’s economic growth forecast in 2021 is revised up to 8.5%. Given the ongoing COVID-19 related challenges, India’s 2021 economic growth forecast is revised slightly down to 9.7%, compared to a contraction of 7.0% in 2020. Brazil’s growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 3.0%, after a contraction of 4.1% in 2020. Russia’s economic growth forecast for 2021 remains at 3.0%, after contracting by 3.1% in 2020. World Oil Demand World oil demand is assumed to have dropped by 9.5 mb/d in 2020, unchanged from last month’s assessment, now estimated to have reached 90.5 mb/d for the year. For 2021, world oil demand is expected to increase by 6.0 mb/d, unchanged from last month’s estimate, to average 96.5 mb/d. Slower than anticipated demand in OECD Americas during 1Q21, together with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in India and Brazil, caused the 1H21 oil demand data to be revised downwards. However, positive transportation fuel data from the US, and acceleration in vaccination programmes in many regions provides further optimism in 2H21. The assumed return to some degree of normality and improved mobility is also expected to positively affect regions such as the Middle East and Other Asia in 2H21. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2020 is estimated to average 62.9 mb/d, a contraction of 2.5 mb/d y-o-y. Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2021 is revised down by 0.2 mb/d from last month’s assessment, and is forecast to grow by 0.7 mb/d to average 63.6 mb/d. This mainly due to the US liquids production outage of 2.2 mb/d seen in February, following the winter storms and freeze. Moreover, the supply forecast in Norway and Canada was also revised down, due to extensive seasonal maintenance. The main drivers for supply growth in 2021 are anticipated to be Canada, Brazil, China, and Norway, while US liquid supply is expected to decline by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 to average 5.2 mb/d, following an estimated contraction of 0.1 mb/d in 2020. OPEC crude oil production in April increased m-o-m by 0.03 mb/d, to average 25.08 mb/d, according to secondary sources. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights Product Markets and Refining Operations Refinery margins in April further extended the trends witnessed in March, with positive performance seen in the Atlantic Basin. In the US Gulf Coast (USGC), margins rose slightly, but in Europe margins increased more markedly with most of the strength derived from the gasoline and jet/kerosene segments as transportation fuel markets in both regions continued to benefit from the heavy turnarounds registered the previous month. This contributed to product tightness and hence supported prices. In contrast, margins in Asia performed negatively as refining economics exhibited losses with pressure coming mainly from the bottom of the barrel as the region remained well supplied and amid demand-side weakness resulting from rising COVID-19 cases in India. Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates declined in April, as the improvement seen last month in the Suezmax and Aframax classes proved temporary and VLCCs rates moved sideways. Rates fell as gains in the Atlantic Basin triggered by the fallout from the February freeze in the USGC subsided. Clean rates rose across the board, except on the North West Europe-to-US East Coast route where rates fell back from the relatively strong levels seen in the prior two months. Dirty tanker rates are not expected to pick up until 2H21 or even 2022, with the latter date more likely. In contrast, the outlook for clean rates is slightly more positive. Crude and Refined Products Trade US crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d in April to reach 6.0 mb/d, the highest in 10 months. US crude exports declined to the lowest since December 2018, averaging 2.6 mb/d. US product imports remained near a 19-month high while product exports rose to the highest since the February freeze disrupted USGC refineries. Japan’s crude imports declined in March after three months of healthy levels, as winter heating demand dissipated. Product imports dropped back from a three-year high, averaging 1.1 mb/d. In China, crude imports remained near a four-month high in March, averaging 11.7 mb/d, while product exports continued moving higher, reaching a ten-month high of 1.7 mb/d, driven by a strong performance of gasoil and jet. India’s crude imports fell to a five-month low in March, averaging 4.3 mb/d. India’s product imports slipped further, while product exports jumped 32% m-o-m, driven by strong outflows of gasoil. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data shows total OECD commercial oil stocks increased by 10.0 mb, m-o-m, in March. At 2,987 mb, they were 13.5 mb higher than the same time a year ago, 37.8 mb above the latest five-year average and 73.0 mb above the 2015–2019 average. Within the components, crude and products stocks rose m-o-m by 6.7 mb and 3.3 mb, respectively. With this, OECD commercial crude stocks stood at 3.4 mb above the latest five-year average and 16 mb above the 2015–2019 average, while product stocks exhibited a surplus of 34.4 mb above the latest five-year average and were 57.0 mb above the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial inventories declined m-o-m by 0.6 days in March to stand at 67.4 days. This is 11.7 days lower than the year-ago level, 1.5 days above the latest five-year average, and 5.1 days above the 2015–2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2020 remained unchanged from the previous month’s assessment at 22.5 mb/d. This is around 6.8 mb/d lower than in 2019. For 2021, demand for OPEC crude was revised up by 0.2 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 27.7 mb/d. This is 5.2 mb/d higher than in 2020. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Non-OPEC oil supply development The year 2020 saw a sudden and unprecedented decline in oil demand due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated oil producing countries around the world to voluntarily shut in, or adjust, oil production in an effort to safeguard the market balance. Consequently, global liquids supply fell by 6.4 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2020 with non-OPEC supply declining by 2.5 mb/d, following growth of 2.1 mb/d in 2019. US liquids production in 2020 fell by 0.8 mb/d, compared to growth of 1.7 mb/d in 2019, mainly through the voluntary temporary shut in of wells. US tight oil production declined by 443 tb/d in 2020, which is 0.1 mb/d more than the 350 tb/d decline witnessed in 2016. However, it is worth noting that production in the Permian managed to register an increase of 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, indicating that some US tight crude production may have become more resilient to a lower oil price environment. In addition to the considerable production adjustments from non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), cumulative curtailments in Canada’s production in March-June 2020 averaged around 1.8 mb/d. Colombia and the UK have also contributed to the production declines in 2020. However, cumulative supply growth by 0.5 mb/d in 2020 came from Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana. With this, E&P oil and gas investment in non-OPEC Graph 1: Non-OPEC investment in oil & gas vs crude countries dropped in 2020 to the lowest level seen in price the last 15 years at US$311 bn, and is expected to US$ bn US$/b remain unchanged in 2021.

Moreover, US core oil identified frac operations indicate m-o-m increases in fracked wells since the low in May 2020except for December and February due to seasonal bad weather. This incremental boost in activity has the potential to nudge 2021 capex levels higher, especially if the current price level continues until the end of the year. This will mean a larger operational well inventory going into 2022.

Nevertheless, OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the DoC will continue to closely monitor these developments to ensure a secure and stable oil supply for the benefit of consumers and producers alike.

North Sea Dated and WTI fell 1.7% and 1.0%, respectively, m-o-m. Spot prices softened on less supportive sentiment in the crude futures market amid the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in several countries, which raised concerns about slowing near-term crude demand. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) price declined $1.32, or 2.0%, m-o-m in April, but remained near its highest level since January 2020 at $63.24/b. All ORB components’ values decreased over the month alongside their perspective crude oil benchmarks. Year-to-date (y-t-d), the ORB value in April was 41.6%, or $17.91, higher than the same period of 2020 at $60.97/b. After five consecutive months of solid gains, crude oil futures prices fell in a volatile month of April, undermined by uncertain oil demand outlooks due to rising COVID-19 cases in several parts of the world, particularly India, Latin America and Japan, that weighed heavily on market sentiment. Nonetheless, robust economic data from the US and China, and improving vaccination rollouts in the US, UK, and some European countries, limited price losses. On a month-on-month (m-o-m) basis, the ICE Brent front month fell by 37¢, or 0.6%, in April to average $65.33/b, and NYMEX WTI decreased by 65¢, or 1.0%, to average $61.70/b. ICE Brent was $17.48 higher y-t-d, or 39.0%, at $62.32/b, while NYMEX WTI was $20.63 higher, or 53.7%, at $59.05/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices fell in April by $1.11 m-o-m, or 1.7%, to settle at $63.27/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $17.29, or 39.4%, at $61.14/b. Hedge funds and other money managers slightly raised their net-long positions in crude during April, recovering part of their net long positions from the sell-off in March, which was mainly concentrated in Brent. However, money managers showed some cautiousness regarding their positioning in crude, as the resurgence in global COVID-19 infections weighed on investor confidence. The market structure of all three major crude futures benchmarks remained in sustained backwardation. However, lower seasonal crude demand, the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in several countries, and the expectation of higher supplies in coming months lessened the backwardation in the key markets. The sweet/sour crude differentials recorded different trends in key markets in April. While the spread continued widening in Europe, it narrowed in the US Gulf Coast (USGC) and remained almost unchanged in Asia on a monthly average. The good performance of light distillate products in key markets, specifically gasoline, compared to heavier distillates was offset by the high availability of light sweet crude. Crude spot prices Spot crude prices averaged lower in April for the first Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement time in six months, with North Sea Dated and WTI US$/b falling 1.7% and 1.0%, respectively, m-o-m, though 80 they remained at high levels not seen in more than a 60 year.

Furthermore, spot prices and crude differentials were under pressure in April on a well-supplied crude market and an overhang of unsold cargoes for April and May loadings, specifically in the Atlantic Basin. Lower OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements production from Libya and the declaration of force majeure at the Marsa El-Hariga terminal had a limited impact on prices as the market was well supplied. Dubai prices also fell in April by 2.3% m-o-m, more than other key benchmarks, as buying interest from Asian refiners lessened in the second half of the month, with market participants expecting higher supplies in the Middle East in the coming months. The light sweet crude value in the Atlantic Basin continued to trade at multi-month lows in April as sellers struggled to place their cargoes for loading in April and May, amid a lack of buying interest from Europe, while an unfavourable west-to-east arbitrage and lower buying interest from China added additional downward pressure. A high value of Brent compared to Dubai made the Brent-related grades less attractive for Asian refiners. On a monthly average, West African crudes tumbled further last month. Crude differentials of Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe moved into deeper discount against the Brent benchmark, falling on a monthly average to discounts of 88¢/b, 70¢/b and $1.06/b, respectively, their lowest since May 2020. In the Mediterranean, the same downward trends were recorded, with the flagship Kazakh crude oil CPC Blend differential dipping in April to a discount of $2.61/b on a monthly average, and a discount of $3/b in late April on daily basis. The sweeter grade, Saharan Blend, also was assessed at a discount of 98¢/b during the same period, unchanged m-o-m. Crude differentials of medium and heavy sweet crude Cabinda fell further in April by 34¢ on average, to a discount of 47¢/b.

In the North Sea, crude differentials also continued to decline in April despite reduced supplies of the five North Sea crude oil grades, which underpinned the North Sea Brent benchmark in May and June. According to Reuters, loading programmes of Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk and Troll will average about 600 kb/d in June, down from an already low level in May of about 638 kb/d. Forties and Ekofisk crude differentials fell by 27¢ and 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements 33¢, respectively, on a monthly average in April to settle at a premium of 41¢/b and 6¢/b. In the USGC, Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars crude differentials also eased despite a recovery in US refining throughputs, falling by 16¢ and 2¢ m-o-m, respectively, to a premium of 2.02¢/b and 26¢/b on average in April. In the Middle East, the sour crude market was firm in most of April, buoyed by healthy demand from Asian refiners, particularly from independents in China, which supported spot prices. By the end of the month, spot values came under pressure as demand from Asian refiners lessened after refiners satisfied their requirements, while worries about lower demand from India due to the COVID-19 situation added downward pressure. M-o-m, the value of the Oman crude differential was little changed, increasing by 5¢ in April to $1.24/b, while the Upper Zakum crude differential fell by 18¢ to a discount of 16¢/b during the same period. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB declined $1.32, or 2.0%, m-o-m in April, but remained near its highest level since January 2020 at $63.24/b. All ORB components’ values decreased over the month alongside their respective crude oil benchmarks, with lighter grades slipping the most. Sour components fell less than the Dubai benchmark as the decline of these components was partly offset by higher official selling prices (OSP) towards the Asian market. The sweeter components fell more than Brent on lower OSPs and crude differentials. Y-t-d, the ORB value in April was 41.6%, or $17.91, higher than the same period in 2020 at $60.97/b. West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend and Zafiro – fell $1.44 in April, or 2.2% m-o-m on average, to $62.86/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy and Kuwait Export – decreased by $1.30, or 2.0% m-o-m on average, to settle at $63.58/b. Murban crude declined by 98¢, or 1.5% m-o-m on average, to settle at $63.35/b, while the Merey component fell by 31¢, or 0.7% m-o-m on average, to settle at 46.16/b. The oil futures market After five consecutive months of solid gains, crude oil futures prices eased in a volatile month of April, undermined by uncertain oil demand outlooks due to the COVID-19 resurgence in several parts of the world with different timing intervals. Investors were sensitive to pandemic developments and to economic indicators. On a monthly average, ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI first month fell 0.6% and 1.0%, respectively. In the first half of April, oil prices remained trading at the low levels registered in late Mach and came under further pressure after lockdown measures and mobility restrictions were extended in some European countries following the fast spread of the third wave of COVID-19 and as the infection rates and hospitalizations remained at high levels. Meantime, the virus spread continued in other parts of the world, particularly in India, Latin America and Japan, which heavily weighed on market sentiment. Slow global vaccination rates and vaccine issues in terms of distribution and side-effects also added to concerns. In the second half of April, the pandemic situation worsened in India, the third-largest oil consumer, and daily infections rose to record levels. The surge in infections raised concerns about the impact on oil demand and potential stricter and longer mobility restrictions and lockdowns. Moreover, April data showed a significant decline in land mobility in India. On the supply side, investors were also assessing the prospect of a rising oil supply from the participating producing countries in the (DoC) in the coming months.

However, the oil price decline was limited as prices recouped part of their losses in the second part of April, buoyed by solid economic data from the US and China, the world’s two largest economies, and from Europe. Along with signs of oil demand recovery in the US and Europe, the positive economic developments offset concerns about the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in India and other countries. Authorities in the US and Europe planned a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, which stoked optimism about the consolidation of the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements oil demand recovery and strengthened the demand outlook for the coming summer holidays season. The progress on vaccinations in the US, UK and some European countries added optimism. Market sentiment was bolstered after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded it projection for global economic growth in 2021 to 6%, and both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) April monthly reports showed upward revisions of global oil demand outlooks, by 0.19 mb/d and 0.23 mb/d respectively. The ICE Brent front month fell by 37¢, or 0.6% m-o-m, in April to average $65.33/b, and NYMEX WTI decreased by 65¢, or 1.0% m-o-m, to average $61.70/b. ICE Brent was $17.48 higher y-t-d, or 39.0%, at $62.32/b, while NYMEX WTI was $20.63 higher, or 53.7%, at $59.05/b, compared with the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices fell in April by $1.11 m-o-m, or 1.7%, to settle at $63.27/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $17.29, or 39.4%, at $61.14/b. On 10 May, ICE Brent stood at $68.32/b and NYMEX WTI at $64.92/b. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened further in April to average $3.62/b, its highest level since May 2020. The ICE Brent value continued to be supported by optimism about the global economic and oil demand recovery, while NYMEX WTI prices remained capped by elevated levels of US crude oil stocks, although they declined in April. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened 28¢ on average in April to $3.62/b. However, the spread between the value of North Sea Dated and WTI Houston narrowed in April by 21¢/b on average to $1.85/b, compared with $2.06/b in March. The value of North Sea Dated and Brent-related crudes were under pressure in April amid an overhang of unsold cargo for April and May loading, subdued demand from Europe and unfavourable arbitrage to the east. Meanwhile, the value of WTI in the USGC found support from improving domestic crude demand as US refineries increased runs, and the weekly US per cent utilization of refinery operable capacity rose to 85.4% in the week to 28 April, the highest since March 2020. Meanwhile, US crude oil exports remained low in the first three weeks of April, averaging about 2.6 mb/d, compared to about 3.1 mb/d in January, according to EIA weekly data. Hedge funds and other money managers raised slightly their net-long positions in crude in April, recovering part of their net long positions from the sell-off in March, which was concentrated in Brent. However, money managers showed some cautiousness regarding their positioning in crude as surging COVID-19 infections in several parts of the world raised concerns about global oil demand and weighed on investor confidence. By late April, combined futures and options net long positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI were still 8.1%, or 60,047 contracts lower compared to the level reached in mid-February 2021 at 677,377 contracts. Between the weeks ending on 6 and 27 April, money managers were net buyers of about 47 mb in both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI.

Between the weeks ending on 30 March and 27 April, combined futures and options net long positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI rose by 5,994 lots, or 0.9%, to 677,377 contracts. The increase was mainly in Brent, while in WTI net long positions fell slightly in April. Money managers were net buyers of more than 15 mb in Brent. Combined futures and options net long positions in Brent rose by 15,320 contracts, or 5.3%, to reach 305,099 lots in the week to 27 April, the highest level since mid-March 2021, according to the ICE Exchange. In the week ending 27 April, gross short positions rose by 2,529 lots, or 3.0%, to 86,505 contracts. Gross long positions rose by 17,849 lots, or 4.8%, to 391,604 contracts during the same period. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements However, hedge funds and other money managers slightly cut their positions related to NYMEX WTI in April. Combined futures and options net long positions in NYMEX WTI decreased by 9,326 contracts, or 2.4%, to 372,278 lots in the week to 27 April. This was due to a rise in short positions by 7,776 lots, or 21.9%, to 43,322 contracts, and long positions fell by 1,550 contracts, or 0.4%, to 415,600 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Consequently, the long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract rose in April, increasing from 4:1 in late March to 5:1 in April. However, the NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio fell to 10:1 in the week to 27 April, compared to 12:1 in late March. Total futures and options open interest volumes on the two exchanges declined further in April, falling by 2.6%, or 162,746 contracts, to stand at 6.1 million contracts in the week ending 27 April. Murban, a new crude oil futures contract in the East of Suez market On 29 March 2021, the East of Suez crude market witnessed the launch of a promising new crude futures contract, Murban crude futures, trading on the new ICE Futures Abu Dhabi (IFAD) commodities exchange. The launch not only provides the market with a new representative crude reference but also will change the way the Murban, Upper Zakum, Das and Umm Lulu crude grades are traded in the market, as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) announced it will remove contractual destination restrictions from June. Furthermore, the trading of Murban is moved from a retroactive official selling pricing mechanism to a marketdriven and forward pricing model. Consequently, it will provide more transparency and more possibilities for market participants to assess arbitrages with other grades. The Murban futures contract has the potential to emerge as a new regional benchmark, given its physical liquidity and its large volume with multiple producers, sellers and customers. One of the most traded crudes in the Middle East spot market, it has an adequate quality as a light sour crude with an API of 40° and a sulphur content of 0.778%. It also has a significant distribution network, diverse export destinations and other assets. Murban enjoys a physical liquidity and is owned by seven companies – the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), BP, Total, China National Petroleum Corporation, Japan Oil Development Co, China ZhenHua Oil Co, and GS Energy. With a production capacity of approximately 2 mb/d, Murban represents more than half of the UAE's total oil production, according to IFAD. Furthermore, IFAD reported that nine large energy traders are joining Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and ADNOC as founding partners in the IFAD exchange – BP, GS Caltex, INPEX, JXTG, PetroChina, PTT, Shell, Total and Vitol. Murban crude oil futures is a physically delivered contract with delivery at the Fujairah loading terminal on a free-on-board basis, with a financial settlement option. Murban crude oil futures have recorded a strong start since late March, with daily trading volume averaging 6,885 lots in April, an equivalent average of about 6.9 mb/d. Daily trading volume reached 18,798 lots on 20 April or the equivalent of about 18.8 mb/d, according to exchange data. Open interest rose to 41,166 contracts on 28 April. The futures market structure Although the market structure of all three major oil benchmarks – ICE Brent, NYMEX WTI and DME Oman – remained in sustained backwardation, lower seasonal crude demand in Europe and Asia, the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in several countries, and expectation of higher supplies in the coming months lessened the backwardation in the key markets, suggesting that the supply-demand balance is softening. ICE Brent backwardation eased slightly in April, compared to a month earlier, coming under pressure from the surge of COVID-19 infections in some countries and extended lockdowns and mobility restrictions in parts of Europe. These developments raised concerns about short-term oil demand recovery, which weighed on nearmonth futures prices, as did the abundant oil supply in the Atlantic Basin. Furthermore, spring refinery maintenance curbed demand in the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. On a monthly average, the ICE Brent M1/M3 spread narrowed by 7¢, from a backwardation of 98¢/b in March, to a backwardation of 91¢/b in April. The ICE Brent’s first to sixth month also narrowed by 51¢ to a $2.10 backwardation in April, which makes it economically unfavourable to store crude oil.

In the US, the NYMEX WTI backwardation structure lessened and the forward curve flattened in the front despite optimism about solid economic data, the accelerating vaccine rollout and recovering US refinery operations. High levels of US crude stocks, including at Cushing, contributed to keeping downward pressure on near-term months compared to forwards. The NYMEX WTI first-to-third-month spread narrowed to a backwardation of 18¢/b on average in April compared to a backwardation of 30¢/b one month earlier. The backwardation structures of DME Oman and of Dubai flattened slightly last month amid subdued demand from Asian buyers in the Middle East spot market in the second half of April, and the prospect of increasing sour crude supply from Middle East producers in the coming months. Concerns about weakening demand from India also contributed to flattening the forward curve. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1/M3 spread narrowed to a backwardation of $1.00/b in April, from a backwardation of $1.18/b in March, or a decrease of 18¢/b. However, the physical Brent market structure strengthened last month, partly supported by a significant reduced supply of the five North Sea crude oil grades underpinning the North Sea Brent benchmark in April, May and June and it was also supported by healthy demand for North Sea crude from European refiners. Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread widened in April on a monthly average by 38¢ to a backwardation of 92¢/b, compared to 54¢/b in March. Nonetheless, in the US, the WTI M1/M3 backwardation narrowed in April by 13¢ to 14¢/b, compared to a backwardation of 27¢/b in March. The Dubai M1/M3 backwardation also narrowed on average in April, contracting by 11¢ to a backwardation of $1.06/b. Crude spreads The sweet/sour crude differentials recorded different trends in April in key markets. While the sweet/sour crude differential continued to widen in Europe, it narrowed in the USGC, and remained almost unchanged in Asia on a monthly average. The good performance of light distillate products, specifically gasoline, compared to heavier distillates was offset by the high availability of light sweet crude. In Europe, the value of light sweet crude continued to Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC rise against Urals, the regional sour reference. The US$/b spread between North Sea Dated and Urals widened 5 further in April by 17¢ to average $1.44/b. This is due 4 to the higher Brent value that was supported by lower 3 Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk and Troll supplies, 2 and as the value of Urals weakened on limited demand 1 for the grade due to refinery maintenance and high 0 availability of unsold cargoes. Urals values were also -1 pressured down by a closed arbitrage to the Asian market as the Brent-Dubai spread remained elevated Jan 21 Jan 21 Feb 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Mar 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 Apr 21 May 21 in April, making the flow to the east unfavourable. On a monthly average, the Urals crude differential against Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals the North Sea Dated in Northwest Europe fell in April LLS-Mars to a discount of $2.80/b on a daily basis, its lowest Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. level since April 2020. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements In Asia, the Tapis/Dubai spread was little changed in April and averaged $2.74/b compared to $2.76/b in March. The spread remained relatively wide compared to 1Q21 and 2020 levels as light sweet crude in Asia continued to be supported by an unfordable west-to-east arbitrage, which is reflected in wide Brent-Dubai spread that made arbitrage of Brent-related light sweet crudes in the Atlantic Basin to Asia difficult, hence supporting light sweet crude value in Asia. The Brent-Dubai front-month exchange of futures for swaps (EFS Dubai) widened further on a monthly average in April, by 62¢, to $3.19/b, compared to $2.57/b in March. Meanwhile, the prospect of higher sour crude supply in the Middle East in the coming months weighed on sour crude value. However, in the USGC, the LLS-Mars spread narrowed in April as the Mars sour crude value declined less than LLS. High availability of light sweet crude in the USGC region, low US crude export levels in the first three weeks of April, and a well-supplied light sweet market in the Atlantic Basin, along with the high volume of unsold barrels, contributed to weakening the value of light sweet crude similar to LLS. Strengthening Mars refining margins in the USGC, compared to LLS, gave some support to Mars sour crude. The LLS-Mars spread narrowed 13¢ m-o-m, to average $1.76/b in April. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 7 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodity prices were mixed in April. There were declines in crude oil and coal, while natural gas rose across regions. Oil prices declined on concerns about the impact of rising COVID-19 infections. Coal prices retreated as Australian exports normalized after witnessing disruptions the previous month. Natural gas prices were particularly supported by lower than average temperatures in Europe, which delayed inventory replenishment. Base metals rose for the twelfth consecutive month. This was driven by persistent expansion in global manufacturing, some easing in the US dollar value, and some concerns about the potential impact on South America output due to rising Covid-19 infections in the region. Gold prices advanced amid a decline in real interest rates. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index retreated m-o-m by 0.5% in April. There were drops in crude oil and coal, while natural gas advanced, the opposite of the previous month. The average index level was up by 46% in the period January-April 2021, compared with the same four months in 2020. The non-energy index rose by 2.7% m-o-m, with base metals rising by 4.1%, and agriculture commodities up by 1.9%. The non-energy index was up by 31.1% in the January-April 2021 period, compared to the same period of 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In April, the Henry Hub natural gas price rose slightly m-o-m to $2.61/mmbtu. Prices weakened at the beginning of the month due to moderate temperatures, however, divergent and more severe weather patterns – either colder than average, or warmer than average depending on the region – that followed resulted in stronger demand. This led to a recovery in prices. IHS Markit estimations referenced that dry gas production was relatively flat during the month. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 60 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 30 April 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 1,958 bcf, around 3.0% below the latest five-year average. At the end of March, stocks were 2.0% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe rose strongly in April with the average Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price up by around 17% m-o-m to $7.1/mmbtu. This was on the back of lower than average April temperatures that spurred demand, and stymied stock increases during the month. EU inventories ended April almost unchanged from the previous month at around 30% full, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Inventories were approximately 62% full at the end of April last year. Stronger TTF prices helped to increase the floor of hubbased prices in Asia. In the period January-April 2021, average prices were 1.3 times higher than in the same timeframe last year. Australian thermal coal prices declined m-o-m by 2.8% in April to $92.2/mt. In the January-April period, prices were around 37.4% higher than in the same there months last year. Prices weakened as supplies from a major Australian coal producing region – affected by flooding the previous month – normalized in April. In addition, concerns about the impact on coal demand of the current wave of Covid-19 infections in major importer India also contributed to the weakening in prices. Additionally, China’s imports have retreated this 8 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Commodity Markets year by 29% in the January-April period, as coal output in the country recovered from the impact of last year lockdowns.

This was driven by a further acceleration in global manufacturing activity, some easing in the US dollar value, and concerns of supply disruptions for selected metals. Average monthly copper prices rose m-o-m in April by 3.7%. Average prices in the January-April period were 58% higher than in the same four months of 2020. Concerns about lower output from South America partly due to a wave of Covid-19 infections in the region, and strong manufacturing activities, supported prices. Stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) were relatively stable, and ended the month of April at 143,725 tonnes from 144,500 tonnes in March. According to the International Copper Study Group (ICGS), the estimation for the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in January 2021 showed a surplus of 32,000 tonnes. Iron ore prices rose m-o-m in April by 6.9% to a monthly average of $179.83/mt. Average prices in the January-April period were 90% higher compared with the same timeframe last year. Steel making activity rose at a global level by 15.2% in March 2021 compared to the same month last year, led by a 19.1% y-o-y increase in China and a 23.9% rise y-o-y in India. Chinese iron ore imports declined slightly by 3.5% during April, but they remain up by 6.7% in the January-April period compared to the same four months last year. In the group of precious metals, gold advanced by 2.4% m-o-m in April as real interest rates in US dollars declined after three consecutive monthly rises. Financial investor’s increased their net long positions for the first time since December. Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ net length decreased in crude oil, natural gas and copper, both in absolute and relative terms as a share of open interest (OI), while it increased for gold.

Those economies that are able to gradually contain the pandemic, thanks to vaccination campaigns and other successful containment strategies, and that also have the financial capabilities to provide economic stimulus measures are rebounding quickly. This is in contrast to those economies that have less access to vaccinations, apply less successful containment strategies and have only limited financial resources for fiscal and monetary stimulus. The US and China are leading the recoveries, while other major OECD economies are also recovering well, albeit at a lower rate, including the Euro-zone and Japan, which are both facing the 2Q21 impacts of lockdowns. India is currently facing severe COVID-19-related challenges and will therefore face a negative impact on its recovery in 2Q21, but it is expected to continue improving its momentum again in 2H21. The laggards in this global recovery are mostly the economies in Latin America, Africa and low-income countries in Asia. The improving situation in OECD Americas, especially in the US, and in China have led to an upward revision of the 2021 global economic growth forecast, which now stands at 5.5%, compared with 5.4% in the previous month. This strong recovery comes after a global GDP decline of 3.5% in 2020. The recovery is very much leaning towards 2H21. The base assumption of this forecast is that by the beginning of 2H21, COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for major emerging economies by then. In addition, forced private household savings during the lock downs are forecast to accelerate global economic growth in 2H21 via pent-up demand, especially in the contact-intensive sectors. As most of the global recovery is expected to materialize later in the year, there are still some significant uncertainties. First and foremost, the path of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the overarching factor impacting the near-term pace of the recovery, with the potential emergence of further harmful COVID-19 variants posing a particular risk. Moreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates could cause severe fiscal strain. While not imminent, a further rise in inflation, especially in the US and the Euro-zone, may cause some tightening of monetary policies, an area that will need to be watched in the short term. This sensitivity and the potential need of rising US interest rates was, notably, raised just recently by the US Treasury Secretary. Additionally, trade-related disputes, especially between the US and China, may continue. The OECD growth estimate for 2020 remains at -4.8%. OECD growth in 2021 has been revised up to 4.8% from the previous month’s 4.6%, lifted in particular by improving growth expectations for OECD Americas, while the Euro-zone and Japan are facing a delayed recovery due to ongoing lockdowns. In the emerging economies, India’s growth forecast for 2021 was revised down to 9.7% from 9.8%, taking into consideration some negative impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 challenges in the country. India’s 2020 GDP growth stood at -7.0%. Following growth of 2.3% in 2020, China’s GDP forecast was revised up to 8.5% in 2021 from 8.4% in the previous report. Brazil’s forecast for 2021 remains at 3.0%, following a contraction of 4.1% in 2020. Russia’s growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 3.0%, after contracting by 3.1% in 2020.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 11 World Economy Global Update on latest developments The global economy’s recovery seems to be gaining pace, very much supported by vaccination drives in OECD countries and unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus measures as well as high savings resulting from lockdowns. The pandemic has so far been very different from other crises as no financial market impairments have led to a broad based destruction of wealth or income nor were any means of production destroyed as was the case in past wars or natural catastrophes. Moreover, the response to the pandemic has been generally quick and forceful in many aspects so far, at least in those economies that can afford offsetting measures. The latest round of fiscal stimulus in the US has led to upgrades to the US forecast as growth, starting in 2Q21 is expected to be well supported, especially when considering the successful and efficient rollouts of vaccination drives. In the OECD, however, the Euro-zone and Japan are experiencing lagging recoveries to some extent, but these are forecast to pick up towards the end of 2Q21. In the emerging economies, it has been primarily China that was able to contain the pandemic, while the second-largest emerging economy, India, is facing ongoing challenges. Russia and Brazil are both still being challenged by COVID-19, but have already started to benefit from the recovery in global trade and the rise in commodities demand, as well as their improving price environment. Globally, the two economies driving the recovery are the US and China. In the US, the exceptional fiscal stimulus of $1.9 trillion in combination with the $900 bn package from the turn of the year and the ongoing monetary stimulus should provide the base for an extraordinary recovery in 2021. The potential net effect of this packages is estimated at 7.5 percentage points. In China, the successful containment of COVID-19 and the further improving domestic recovery have also already provided a strong base for the global economic rebound. However, the impact from the pandemic is still being felt in 1H21, with the EU, Latin America and India seeing rising infections and, consequently, lockdowns of various degrees that are harming the economic dynamic of affected countries. Global trade levels — an important motor for the Graph 3 1: Global trade ongoing recovery — have continued improving, % change y-o-y according to data available up to January. This is 10 7.9 thanks to the base effects from the large declines in 5 the last year, but also due to the ongoing rebound in 0 5.3 global economic activity. The greatest beneficiary of -5 this momentum is China, with the largest share in -10 global exports. Out of the top 20 exporters in the -15 world, China’s total market share in global exports in 2020 stood at around 25% compared to an average -20 Feb 19 Apr 19 Jun 19 Aug 19 Oct 19 Dec 19 Feb 20 Apr 20 Jun 20 Aug 20 Oct 20 Dec 20 Feb 21 of around 20% over 2017-19, based on data by Allianz SE. In February, world trade volumes rose by 5.3% y-o-y, after a rise of 5.2% y-o-y in January, based on Global trade volume Global trade value the CPB World Trade Index provided by the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.

Trade improved in value terms as well, rising by 7.9% y-o-y in February, compared with 5.9% y-o-y in January. Near-term expectations The near-term expectations and world economic growth forecast for 2021 are very much guided by the likelihood and therefore thee underlying assumption that, by the beginning of 2H21, COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for major emerging economies by then. While growth in 1Q21 will still be particularly hit by the pandemic across the world, the recovery in OECD Americas, particularly in the US by 2Q21, is forecast to gradually lift the momentum. However, the Euro-zone, Japan, Latin American economies and, importantly, India will still be impacted by COVID-19 to a larger extent in 2Q21. With these base-assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is forecast to stand at 0.4% q-o-q and to accelerate to a level of 1.4% q-o-q in 2Q21. The major acceleration is then forecast to materialize in the 2H21 with 3Q21 growth forecast at 2.6% q-o-q and 4Q21 growth at 1.9% q-o-q. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Economy The recovery in 2H21 will be significantly supported by a rebound in contact-intensive sectors, especially travel and tourism, as well as leisure and hospitality. The summer travel season in the northern hemisphere will add more support. Moreover, it is assumed that inflation will remain at reasonable levels so that central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates unexpectedly. However, most recent comments by the US Treasury Secretary that an interest rate rise may be necessary in order to avoid an overheating of the economy is pointing to the challenges of balancing stimulus and monetary policies. This is of even greater important as the US administration is planning to add further major stimulus plans. One is the infrastructure initiative, the American Jobs Plan, with an amount of around $2 trillion. The second one is the family and social support initiative, the American Family Plan, with an amount of around $1.8 trillion. Both plans are supposed to be spent over ten years and will most likely become GDP effective only in the coming year. However, it is likely that it will already have some positive impact towards the end of the year. Global purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) in Graph 3 2: Global PMI April reflected a tender continuation of the global Index recovery. The global manufacturing PMI stood at 60 56.6 55.8 in April, following an already strong index of 55 55.8 in March and 53.9 in February. The global services 50 sector PMI rose as well, standing at 56.6 in April, 40 after 54.7 in March and 52.8 in February. 30 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 Manufacturing PMI Services PMI Sources: JP Morgan, IHS Markit, Haver Analytics and OPEC.

Among the most pressing issues are the possibility of Note: * 2021 = Forecast. emerging new COVID-19 variants and the Source: OPEC. consequent efficacy of vaccines. Furthermore, the danger of rising interest rates, especially in the US, and consequent repercussions for the global economy will need close monitoring. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments In the US, while 1Q21 growth was still impacted by COVID-19 in addition to the cold snap in Texas, GDP growth was stronger-than expected at 6.4% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR). The $900 billion fiscal stimulus package that was enacted at the end of last year has very likely counterbalanced some of the impact from COVID-19. The latest fiscal stimulus package, the America Rescue Plan Act, at a magnitude of $1.9 trillion and signed into law in March is providing a further strong base to keep the recovery going. In the meantime, the COVID-19 vaccination drive has gained further momentum in the US with nearly 50% of the population having now received at least a first shot. The latest announcement of the new US administration pointed to the goal of having at least 70% of the population receiving at least one vaccination by 4 July, US Independence Day. The successful vaccination campaign, the unprecedented fiscal and OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 13 World Economy monetary stimulus and forced savings during the past year’s lockdown periods will provide a sound base for a strong recovery in the remainder of the year and especially in 2H21. The net personal savings rate in March stood at 27.6%, compared to averages of past years of around 7%. In addition to the ongoing fiscal stimulus, the new US administration has announced two further fiscal stimulus packages. The first is the American Jobs Plan, at an amount of more than $2 trillion. This should provide significant support to infrastructure improvements while stimulating economic growth. The second stimulus package is a family and social support initiative, the American Family Plan, with a magnitude of $1.8 trillion. This is aimed at improving education and providing financial and childcare support to families. Both packages are scheduled for 10 years and assuming that they will be approved after negotiations later in the year, they will have only a minor GDP effect, if at all, in the current year, but may provide a lift in sentiment going forward. In the meantime, the Fed has also continued its strong support, expanding its balance sheet by $326 billion in 1Q21, pointing to a continuation of its accommodative monetary policy. However, just recently and notably, the Treasury Secretary signalled the likelihood of rising interest rates to avoid overheating the economy, a development that will need to be carefully monitored. In the meantime, important lead-indicators are pointing to a continued improvement into 2Q21. Consumer confidence rose strongly to reach 121.7 in April, compared with 109 in March and 90.4 in February, based on the index provided by the Conference Board. The labour market softened in April, contrary to Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market expectations. The unemployment rate rose slightly % % to 6.1% compared to 6% in March and 6.2% in 62 61.7 16 February. Non-farm payroll additions increased by 12 266.000 and showed a weakening trend, after also 61 downwardly revised additions of 770.000 for March. 8 Employers have pointed at the challenges to recruit 60 and it seems that the ongoing social welfare support 6.1 4 in combination with parents that were still needed at 59 0 home for childcare in April and other factors keeping Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 the labour market currently from regaining strength.

However, this may be inflationary and Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics. may pose another challenge. Near-term expectations With the success in lifting vaccination rates to almost 50%, the large fiscal stimulus that was enacted in March and now the rising likelihood that the recovery will continue, growth expectations for the US economy have been raised for 2021. The America Rescue Plan Act leans significantly towards lifting consumption with a $1,400 payment to less affluent US citizens. That accounts for more than $400 billion of the total package. Another important lift to consumption should come from an increase in unemployment benefits, accounting for more than $200 billion. These two measures alone are forecast to lift US growth by around 2.5% this year. The total GDP lift from the American Rescue Plan may reach up to around 7.5 percentage points for 2021, according to the Secretariat’s findings. The effectiveness of these and other stimulus measures will determine how much US GDP growth will be supported, but as it seems that further measures could move US GDP growth up to 7% or higher in 2021. This will, furthermore, support global economic growth by around 2 percentage points this year. During 1Q21, GDP growth was still impacted by COVID-related lockdown measures, holding GDP growth at 6.4% q-o-q SAAR. In 2Q21, growth is forecast to accelerate to 9.2% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21. This is a strong lift from last month’s expectations of 7.2% quarterly growth. Growth in 3Q21 is forecast to reach 7% q-o-q SAAR, and then slow down to 3% q-o-q SAAR in 4Q21. The major push in economic growth is forecast to come from consumer spending and investment. From a sectorial viewpoint, the major contribution to the recovery is expected to come from the contact-intensive service sectors, which are likely to see a strong rebound starting in 2Q21. Given that the services sector constitutes more than two-thirds of the US economy, this is likely to boost consumption going forward. While concern has come and may continue to come from inflation, price increases seem to be well anchored as the labour market in particular does not show signs of overheating, which would lead to significant wage growth and quickly rising underlying inflation. The main uncertainties in the forecast are either that COVID-19 will not be contained and/or that inflation will rise at such a pace that market rates will carry an unexpected dynamic, impairing the ongoing recovery. However, even with the ongoing low interest rate environment, rising debt levels and associated debt services 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Economy may cause fiscal constraints going forward. These factors will require close monitoring, but are not expected to pose an imminent challenge. Also, the new Administration has proposed targeted tax increases in its America Tax Plan, which could lead up to an additional tax income of $3 trillion over the coming years. This should counterbalance the fiscal burden if the burden is mostly geared towards the relatively affluent part of the population and therefore does not significantly weigh on growth. The economy’s recovery continues to be reflected in Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and April’s PMI levels as provided by the Institute for non-manufacturing indices Supply Management (ISM), indicating an ongoing Index pickup in the coming months. Also, a relative switch 70 became visible from the manufacturing sector to the 65 62.7 services sector.

The previous growth estimate for 2020 was confirmed by the US statistical offices at -3.5%. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Euro-zone’s economic development was hit again by negative growth in 1Q21 amid the broad-based lockdown measures that were implemented at the beginning of the year in most Euro-zone economies. 1Q21 GDP growth was reported at -0.6% q-o-q seasonally adjusted (SA), translating into a yearly decline of -1.8%. So far, particularly those economies with a large tourism and travel sector have been most strongly affected. The slowing momentum from 1Q21 is anticipated to have carried over into the first weeks of 2Q21 as lockdown measures continued in some countries of the Euro-zone and became even tighter than at the beginning of the year. In the meantime, vaccination rates defined as those having received at least one shot are rising steadily across the Euro-zone, now reaching around 25% in the major economies, reaching almost 30% in Germany, almost 27% in Spain, around 25% in Italy and around 24% in France. The vaccination drive is accelerating fast and expected to reach more than 50% in the summer time. This has already allowed some countries to gradually lift some of the lockdown measures and consequently mobility has already started to rise. The European Central Bank (ECB), has continued its accommodative monetary policies. However, growth in lending to the private sector, an important lifeline of liquidity in the Euro-zone, has slowed down over the last months, albeit it remains at a strong level. Lending to the private sector by monetary financial institutions stood at 3.2% y-o-y in March, after 3.8% y-o-y in both January and February and 4.2% y-o-y in both December and November. With the rising activity in Euro-zone economies, lending is forecast to pick up again, especially OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 15 World Economy after the ECB announced in March that it would like to accelerate the pace of its bond buying programme over the next three months in response to rising borrowing costs and a continued fragile economic recovery.

Near-term expectations The momentum in vaccinations in combination with the EUR 750 billion recovery fund, the NextGenerationEU, are considered to build a strong base for a 2H21 recovery. In addition, the momentum in the Euro-zone’s major trading partners, the US and China, is gaining considerable pace. US stimulus will facilitate US-bound exports. The ongoing recovery in Asian economies — especially China and to some extent India and Japan in 2H21 — is anticipated to benefit growth in the Euro-zone as well. Hence, in addition to domestic progress, the Eurozone is forecast to achieve progress particularly in 2H21. 1Q21 GDP growth was reported at -2.5% q-o-q SAAR, affected by lockdowns and other COVID-19-related social-distancing measures. By 2Q21, growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.2% q-o-q SAAR. The main pick-up on a quarterly level is then forecast to materialize in 3Q21, when domestic consumption, investments and a rise in exports are all forecast to lift GDP growth to 10.8% q-o-q SAAR. 4Q21 is still expected to be strong and reach 8.2% q-o-q SAAR. The recovery is thus forecast to be delayed when compared to the US and China, which both have a more frontloaded recovery. This, in turn, may also fuel foreign direct investments into the Euro-zone in 2H21 and support the Euro, but this will also depend on interest rate developments in the US. Domestically, the expected normalization of social activities will have a positive effect with travel and transportation, leisure and the hospitality sector forecast to be the main beneficiaries, while the manufacturing sector’s rebound will taper off somewhat. The April PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed to Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs an ongoing improving situation in the manufacturing Index and services sectors. Momentum in the services 70 sector is forecast to gain significant pace in the 60 62.9 coming months. The manufacturing PMI rose to 62.9 50 50.5 in April, compared with 62.5 in March and 57.9 in February. The PMI for services, the largest sector in 40 the Euro-zone, rose to 50.5 in April, standing above 30 the growth indicating level of 50 for the first time since 20 August 2020, when lockdown measures had been 10 lifted in the Euro-zone.

The GDP growth estimate for 2020 remains at -6.8%. OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Japan’s economy continues recovering with improving lead-indicators and also production numbers pointed at good momentum in the recent past. New lockdowns had to be implemented for the prefectures of Tokyo and Osaka, given a worsening COVID-19 situation. It is only that in late March lockdowns were lifted, leading to strongly rising mobility and unfortunately again rising infections afterwards. This volatile situation has now led to these renewed lockdown measures, with a consequent negative impact on 2Q21 growth. The current lockdown measures have now become even more stringent than on previous occasions and the necessity to progress on the vaccination drive is becoming more imminent for the government, especially with the SummerOlympics in Tokyo getting closer. The government is now aiming at getting the part of the population older than 65 vaccinated by summer. This accounts for around a third of the population. Impacted by already strong lockdown-measures during 1Q21, GDP growth is estimated to have declined by 2.5% q-o-q SAAR. In the meantime, consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved, confirming an improving pace, despite the re-emerging lockdown measures. In its latest meeting the Bank of Japan (BoJ) confirmed it accommodative monetary policy. The BoJ’s basic assumptions remain unchanged, stating that the economy has picked up and revising even up slightly its fiscal year growth forecast, ending in March 2022, to 4% from previously 3.9%. Growth in industrial production (IP) turned positive. The IP rose by 1.5% y-o-y in March, compared with declines of 3.1% y-o-y in February and 1.4% y-o-y in January. This was very likely supported by both the pick-up in exports, benefitting from improved global trade and also rising mobility. In addition, growth in manufacturing orders recovered as well, rising by 40.7% y-o-y in February, however, this was influenced by the base-effect of March last year, when it declined by 7.7% y-o-y at the onset of the pandemic. However, the pick-up was also visible in a quarterly view, as orders rose by 25% q-o-q seasonally adjusted. Growth in exports recovered strongly as well, rising Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports by 16.1% y-o-y in March on a non-seasonally adjusted % change y-o-y base, following a decline of 4.5% y-o-y in February. 20 Retail sales picked up, despite the impact of 16.1 lockdown measures, expanding by 5.2% y-o-y in 10 March, after a rise of 3.7% y-o-y in February and 0 growth of 2.7% y-o-y in January. -10 Consumer confidence retracted slightly, as reported by the Cabinet Office.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 17 World Economy Near-term expectations By summer the elderly population – defined as older than 65 years is expected to be fully vaccinated and it is expected that by then it will not be necessary any more that the government will impose lockdown measures, and at least not as restrictive as the current ones. Hence, Japan is forecast to be able to participate in the global recovery in both external and domestic trade. Amid the new lockdown measures it remains to be seen what the mobility trend in the coming weeks will look like. Given that the level of stringency of the lockdown has been increased compared to previous ones, it is likely to drag growth by around 1 percentage points in 2Q21. It is estimated that 1Q21 GDP declined by 2.5% q-o-q SAAR. As it is assumed that the virus will be widely contained in Japan towards the end of 2Q21 a strong rebound is expected by 2H21. Growth in 2Q21 is forecast to rise by 2% q-o-q SAAR. However, this is lower than in the last month’s forecast, when the quarterly growth forecast stood at 3.2% q-o-q SAAR. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 then should pick up with the global economy’s recovery gaining pace and also domestic demand in Japan expected to rise further. Hence, growth is forecast at 5% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21, before slowing somewhat to reach 3% in 4Q21. The ongoing recovery is also reflected in the latest Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs PMIs from April with both the manufacturing and the Index services sector accelerating. The manufacturing PMI 60 rose to 53.6, compared with 52.7 in March. The PMI 53.6 50 for the services sector, which constitutes around two49.5 thirds of the Japanese economy, rose to 49.5, after 40 48.3 in March, however, still slightly below the growth 30 indicating level of 50. 20 10 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit, Nikkei and Haver Analytics.

Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments The Chinese real GDP grew 18.3% y-o-y in 1Q21, after a 6.5% growth in the 4Q20, recording the strongest pace of expansion since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992. The growth was boosted by strengthening domestic and global consumption thanks to the strict virus containment measures and continued fiscal and monetary support. Yet it is important to notice that 1Q21 growth rate reflected a low comparison base in 2020 when activity plunged due to the COVID-19 shocks. In 2020, the country's GDP expanded 2.3%, the slowest pace in more than four decades. Comparing 1Q21 to 4Q20, primary industry rose by 4.0 percentage points from 4.1% y-o-y to 8.1% y-o-y, while secondary industry jumped by 17.6 percentage points, recording double digit growth of 24.4% y-o-y following expansion of 6.8% y-o-y. Similarly, the services industry expended by 15.6% y-o-y compared to 6.7% y-o-y. 18 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Economy On the demand side, final consumption expenditure flipped to the growth territory following four quarters of contraction as it expanded by 11.6% y-t-d in 1Q21 following a contraction of 0.5% y-t-d in 4Q20. Gross capital formation grew 4.5% y-t-d in 1Q21, compared to 2.2% y-t-d in 4Q20. Net exports expanded 2.2% y-t-d versus 0.6% y-t-d in 4Q20. Total domestic demand recorded double-digit growth of 16.1% y-t-d in 1Q21 up from 1.7% y-t-d in 4Q20. Nevertheless, it is important to note that consumption still lagged behind investment. On the supply side, most of the sectors recorded a double-digit expansion. Industry GDP recorded growth of 24.4% y-o-y in 1Q21 following 6.9% y-o-y in 4Q20. Out of this industry growth, the manufacturing sector expanded by 26.8% y-o-y in 1Q21 compared with 7.3% y-o-y in 4Q20. Construction GDP expanded by 22.8% y-o-y in 1Q21 versus 6.6% y-o-y in 4Q20. The transportation and telecommunication sector rose 32.1% y-o-y following a growth of 7.6% y-o-y in 4Q20. Similarly, the hospitality industry surged 43.7% y-o-y in 1Q21 following 2.7% y-o-y in 4Q20. Meanwhile, agriculture GDP expanded by 8.0% y-o-y in 1Q21 compared with 4.2% in 4Q20. China’s trade continued its out-performance driven by the global fiscal stimulus in developed economies. In April 2021, China’s trade surplus was $42.8 billion, compared with a surplus of $45.0 billion in April 2020, amid improving global demand and higher commodity prices. Exports expanded 32.3% y-o-y while imports surged 43.1% y-o-y, signalling strong domestic demand and soaring commodity prices. Moreover, exports may have boosted because of the resurgence of the COVID-19 cases in other developing countries, including India and in Southeast Asia. Over the first four months of 2021, the trade surplus expanded sharply to $157.91 billion, from $55.65 billion in the same period of 2020. Concurrently, China’s trade surplus with the US rose to $28.11 billion from $21.37 billion in March. Indeed, the US accounted for about 16% of Chinese exports in April while Southeast Asian nations accounted for 15.6% and the EU purchased 15.1%. On the policy front, Beijing has launched a new (14th) Five-Year Plan (FYP), presenting a GDP growth target of above 6% for 2021. China’s “dual circulation” is prioritizing expanding household spending, as thus far Chinese consumers may not be spending enough to power a broad recovery. China’s government launched a series of promotional activities to boost domestic consumption, one of which was a month long shopping campaign during the month of May. Simultaneously, online shopping platforms would offer sales on food, travel, and cultural and sporting products for half a month. In March 2021, China’s retail sales surged 34.2% y-o-y, stronger than the 33.8% expansion in January-February. More significantly, retail revenues increased significantly compare to pre-pandemic level, as it went up 12.9% compared to March 2019. The government also extended the financial relief measures for small and micro businesses that was in place from 2018 until 2020. The plan encourages the local governments to lower loan guarantee costs by about 1.5% or below for these businesses. The extension will stay effective till 2023. Additionally, in order to support the ongoing recovery, the government promised to deliver $84 billion in tax cuts for small and micro-sized businesses as well as companies in advanced manufacturing. However this policy step might damage local governments’ finances which indeed have been constrained as their debts have been surging amid the defaults of wave of state-owned businesses in 2020. Overall, China’s augmented fiscal deficit that includes off-budget spending, increased in 2020 to 13.2% of GDP from 11.2% in 2019.

Near-term expectations Looking forward, the overall economic climate in China is historically sharp as all macroeconomic monthly and first quarter indicators recorded substantial recovery on a year-to-year base. Both consumption and investment are keeping the momentum. Yet, consumption growth still lagging slightly behind. A robust consumption growth is a key tool for the policy-makers to normalize macroeconomic conditions. In the interim, the PMI indices OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 19 World Economy reflect the sustained manufacturing and services sector recovery as well as the bounce back from the temporary fall amid the New Year holiday restrictions. The Manufacturing PMI increased to 51.9 in April Graph 3 10: China’s PMI 2021 from 50.6 in March, while the services PMI rose Index as well to 56.3 from 54.3, following the successful 60 containment of COVID-19 and a further improvement 56.3 55 54.7 in demand. 51.9 50 The economic growth forecast is to continue its robust path amid surging exports and robust growth in 45 manufacturing investment, as well as household 40 spending, which is gaining more momentum amid the Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 decline in public health concerns.

Other Asia India Update on the latest developments After the positive outlook anticipated for India’s economy in 2021, the latest COVID-19 wave provided acute challenges for India, especially in 1H21. The new COVID-19 variant put major cities under city-state wide lockdowns and localized restrictions, which might continue throughout the 2Q21. Yet the less stringent lockdown measures might combine with resilient consumer and business behaviour and mitigate the economic impact of the new restrictions. Certainty, most available macroeconomic indicators might not reflect the acute economic climate as some of them are lagging behind and are skewed heavily by the low comparison base. On the consumption end, the most recent passenger vehicle sales data released in March suggested an expansion of 115% y-o-y following 18% (growth?) y-o-y in February. Car sales grew by 95% y-o-y, while utility vehicle sales surged by 153% y-o-y and two-wheeler sales were up by 73% y-o-y. Tractor sales growth jumped by 172% y-o-y. Nevertheless, considering the noticeable drop in mobility rate starting late March, consumption growth might move to negative territory. The unemployment rate in India decreased by 6.50% in March from 6.90 % in February of 2021. Geographically, rural unemployment fell to 6.3% from 7.5%. Similarly, urban unemployment fell to 7.4% from 7.7%. Unsurprisingly, the unemployment rate is most likely to surge in the near term specifically in the urban areas. 20 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Economy On the policy front, the Indian parliament in late 2020 Graph 3 11: India's GDP quarterly growth passed substantial structural reforms aiming to % change y-o-y support economic growth, including agricultural 12 sector reforms and the government consolidated and 4.8 6 0.4 liberalized labour laws in addition to privatizing SOEs 0 to open up more sectors for private business. -6 Moreover, the government offer changes to legislation related to e-commerce, and a modest -12 -7.0 liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) -18 regulations.

Needless to say, this might push total expenditure to record levels. The fiscal deficit might narrow amid recovery in tax revenue and the SOE’s privatising plan. Furthermore, the government might gradually consolidate the public finances in the near future if the anticipated 2H21 recovery materialized. According to official statements, India’s fiscal deficit is expected to remain around 6.8% of GDP in the fiscal year (FY) 20212022, while it stands at 9.5% of GDP in the period 2Q21-1Q22.

The anticipated increased in liquidity because of securities buying has been an important factor behind the recent decline in the rupee. However, these RBI efforts may elevate the risk of crowding out private-sector borrowing for the government one.

Near-term expectations India’s current situation combined with the slowing vaccination rate might lead to a contraction in 2Q21 amid the introduction of restriction measures. The economy is forecast to resume its recovery in 2H21 under the assumption of the virus being under control through boosted vaccination rates alongside group immunity. Indeed, the government already approved several international vaccines as well as offering funds to domestic vaccines companies to enlarge their vaccine production.

However, on a seasonally adjusted month-to-month base, according to IBGE (the national statistics institute), industrial production fell for the second consecutive month by 2.4% amid the rising input supply constraints and weak domestic demand due to the rising in new COVID-19 cases. The unemployment rate (three-month moving average to February) rose to 14.4% from 14.2% in the three months to January 2021. This was the highest jobless rate on a quarterly basis since the three months to September of 2020. The number of unemployed persons increased by 2.9% to 14.42 million.

Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments South Africa's economy contracted by 6.9% y-o-y in 2020, following an expansion of 1.5% y-o-y in 2019. The sharpest economic contraction was recorded in the 2Q20 amid the adoption of restrictive containment measures, which certainly slowed down the economy. On the consumption front, more positive data have been released. The retail activities moved to the positive territory. Retail trade rose by 2.3% y-o-y, following an upwardly revised 3.7% y-o-y drop in January recording the first gain in retail activity since March 2020. Meanwhile, like many other countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a number of challenges, one of which is the elevated debt level. The government debt to GDP increased to 83% in 2020 from 62.20% in 2019. Debt may climb even higher to meet the COVID-19 vaccine needs or additional liabilities for the old debt. However, South Africa’s budget deficit for the 2020-21 fiscal year was smaller than the government projection as it stood at 11.2% of GDP instead of the projected 12.3%. The consumer price index jumped to 3.2% y-o-y in March of 2021 following 2.9% y-o-y in February, above the central bank lower band of the target range of 3.6%. Inflationary pressure driven mainly by increasing prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index surged 0.7% y-o-y yet unchanged from previous month. On the labour market end, South Africa's unemployment rate increased to 32.5% in the 4Q20 from 30.8% in 3Q20 registering the highest jobless rate since quarterly data became available in 2008. However, over the same comparison period the unemployment rate based on the expanded definition which includes people who have stopped looking for a work, stood at 42.6%, down from 43.1%. On the policy front, following the commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for rapid financing, the government’s post pandemic plan prioritised investment, job creation and power supply. Meanwhile, the South African Reserve Bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged at 3.5% at its March 2021 meeting. The central bank raised its 2021 growth forecasts to 3.8% from an earlier 3.6%, but maintained its projections of 2.4% and 2.5% for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Near-term expectations An improvement in mobility as measured by the Google Mobility index and a slowdown in new COVID-19 cases were major factors in the first two months of 2020 increased optimism for a faster economic recovery. However the emergence of a new virus variation represents a real threat to the recovery in 2021. Business confidence according to the RMB/BER index dropped to 35 in 1Q21 from 40 in the 4Q20, despite the relaxation of some COVID-19 restrictions. Similarly, South Africa's Absa Manufacturing PMI dropped to 56.2 in April from 57.4 in March. Needless to say, this reflects the reliance of the recovery on COVID-19 vaccinations, which is well behind the government’s target of reaching herd immunity by the end of 2021.

Industrial production expanded 1.1% y-o-y in March of 2021, recording the first gain in 2021. In 1Q21, industrial production shrank 1.2% y-o-y. The labour market also continued improving, with unemployment edged down in March to 5.4% from 5.7% in the previous month. This was the lowest rate since March 2020 but still above pre-pandemic levels. However, retail trade continued slowing down as it dropped 3.4% y-o-y in March 2021, following an upwardly revised 1.5% decline in February amid the pandemic crisis. Retail activity contracted 1.6% y-o-y over the 1Q21 while consumer confidence indicator increased 5 points from the -21 points in 4Q20.

The non-oil sector dropped by 2.7% y-o-y, a relatively smaller drop compared to many other G20 countries amid the relatively small services sector and young population. The substantial drop was in the oil sector, which contracted by 6.7% y-o-y amid the sizable drop in oil prices in 2020. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s economy is set for a turnaround in 2021 supported by a noticeable recovery in oil prices and improving conditions for non-oil sectors combined with stimulus policies and the effective containment of COVID-19. The business PMI index rebounded in April, reflecting a strengthening of growth across the non-oil economy. Non-oil private sector activity grew for an eighth consecutive month, and the Kingdom’s Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 55.2 in April from 53.3 in March. A further positive outlook is anticipated amid government efforts to achieve greater economic diversification and increased foreign investment supported by the new draft of corporate law and an increased focus on privatizations. Nigeria Nigeria’s real GDP grew by 0.1% y-o-y in 4Q20, following a 3.6% contraction in 3Q20. This was the first positive quarterly growth in the last three quarters amid the gradual return of economic activities. The non-oil sector expanded 1.7%, recovering from a 2.5% decline in 3Q20, mainly driven by growth in the telecommunications and information services sectors. Other important contributions came from the agricultural sector, which expanded by 3.4% y-o-y in 4Q20. Meanwhile, the oil sector dropped by 19.8% y-o-y after a 13.9% y-o-y contraction in 3Q20. On a quarterly basis, GDP grew by 9.7%, following 12.1% growth in 3Q20. In 2020, the economy contracted 1.9% y-o-y, following a 2.3% y-o-y expansion in 2019. In the meantime, the Stanbic IBTC Bank Nigeria PMI stood at 52.9 in April 2021, unchanged from March. Inflation was still structurally high, with the annual inflation rate jumping to 18.17% in March 2021, the highest rate since January 2017 amid the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has also weakened the currency. These inflationary pressures might slow the economic recovery in 2021. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) The IHS Markit UAE PMI rose to 52.7 in April 2021 from 52.6 in the March. This was the strongest reading since July 2019 amid the expansion in output and business confidence, reflecting a recommencement of economic recovery from the pandemic. The rapid vaccine rollout led to the scaling-back of many domestic restrictions, which improved business sentiment. However, international restrictions, especially on travellers from India, remain in place amid the new variants of the virus. This might affect the ongoing recovery as UAE is a global travel hub and important link for South Asian travellers. Tighter travel restrictions might also have an impact on the UAE's tourism sector, which accounts for about 16% of GDP. This sector is anticipated to pick up this year amid the delayed Dubai Expo 2020 event. Nevertheless, a continued recovery from COVID-19, in addition to large-scale projects, new visa rules and the delay of Expo 2020 are all supporting a strong pick-up in growth in 2H21. 26 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Economy The impact of the US dollar (USD) and inflation on oil prices The pace of US dollar (USD) appreciation against Graph 3 20: ORB crude oil price index compared majors during the previous two months stalled in April with different currencies (base January 2016 = 100) as interest rates expectations in USD declined during Index the month.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 27 World Oil Demand World Oil Demand World oil demand is assumed to have contracted by 9.5 mb/d in 2020, unchanged from last month’s assessment, and is now estimated to average 90.5 mb/d for the year. OECD oil demand is estimated to have declined by 5.6 mb/d due to a large drop in OECD Americas and Europe, on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, non-OECD oil demand is estimated to have decreased by 3.9 mb/d, led by declines in Other Asia, Middle East and Latin America. For 2021, world oil demand is expected to increase by 6.0 mb/d, unchanged from last month’s estimate, to average 96.5 mb/d. Slower-than-anticipated demand in OECD Americas during the 1Q21 combined with the resurgence in COVID-19 infection cases in India and Brazil caused the 1H21 oil demand data to be downwardly revised. On the other hand, for the 2H21, positive weekly transportation fuels data from the US, and the acceleration in vaccination programs in many regions allows for optimism. The assumed return to normality and improved mobility will also positively influence regions such as the Middle East and Other Asia in 2H21. In the OECD region, oil demand is anticipated to show a 2.7 mb/d y-o-y increase as oil demand gains traction especially in OECD America, the largest contributor to oil demand growth in 2021. However, oil demand in the region is not anticipated to fully recover from the 2020 decline. Rebounding transportation fuels, mainly gasoline, in addition to healthy lightand middle-distillate requirements are assumed to support the oil demand recovery going forward. In the non-OECD region, oil demand is estimated to rise by 3.3 mb/d as compared to 2020. Demand growth is anticipated to be driven by China, followed by India and Other Asia. A healthy rebound in economic momentum is anticipated to stimulate industrial fuel demand. Demand for petrochemical feedstock is also projected to support demand growth in 2021. Similar to last month’s assessment, uncertainties remain unusually high particularly due to issues related to COVID-19 developments, including potential increase in infection cases, the emergence of new variants and the acceleration or deceleration of vaccination rollouts. Other factors to be monitored closely over the short term include developments in the global and regional economic outlooks, progress in industrial activity and labor markets and the effect of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures.

OECD OECD Americas Update on the latest developments Stagnating gasoline demand in OECD Americas led Graph 4 1: OECD Americas oil demand, y-o-y to a decline of more than 3.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in February change 2021 for all petroleum products. This is compared to mb/d a loss of nearly 2.2 mb/d y-o-y in January and around 3.2 mb/d lower than in February 2019. Gasoline 6 demand was largely impacted by reduced mobility in 4 the US and to lesser extent in Canada and Mexico. Gasoline demand continued to show a 1.6 mb/d y-o-y 2 contraction in February after recording a similar 0 decline in January. Jet fuel demand was also steeply -2 in negative territory, impacted by reduced international travel across all of OECD Americas -4 region.

Source: OPEC. Sluggish transportation fuel consumption negatively impacted US oil demand in February 2021. Gasoline and jet fuel dropped by 1.8 mb/d, y-o-y, after declining by around 1.7 mb/d, y-o-y, in January. Reduced mobility due to partial closure of restaurants, cinemas and leisure centres in a number of states as well as a cold snap in the state of Texas limited transportation fuel demand. The vehicles miles of travel indicator fell by 12.1%, following a decline of 11.3% in January, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to force changes to airline schedules and operations during the month of February, affecting jet fuel demand. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics airlines reported around 350,000 scheduled domestic flights in February following around 379,000 flights in January and more than 623,000 flights in February of last year and the all-time monthly low of 180,151 flights in May 2020. Out of the 350,000 flights scheduled in February, more than 20 thousand flights were cancelled. Jet fuel demand lingered around a decline of more than 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in February almost matching January’s drop. Diesel’s OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 29 World Oil Demand performance has been steady over the December-to-February period, dropping by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. However, on-road diesel, including trucking diesel, posted solid y-o-y gains driven by steady trading and industrial activities. According to Federal Reserve Board, the US industrial production index recorded 104.1 in February after posting 106.9 in January.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Near-term expectations As new daily COVID-19 infection cases in the US continued to fall from the January-February peak, mobility is assumed to gain momentum as April weekly data showed strong gasoline demand growth according to preliminary weekly EIA data. The latest data show that driving has risen to matching levels to 2019 owing to speedy vaccination rates. Going forward, supported by a rise in mobility during the summer driving season, higher vaccination rates in the US and large stimulus measures are assumed to help economic activity rebound strongly supporting demand for petroleum products in the 2H21. COVID-19 related developments and the speed of the vaccination rollout provide reasons for the positive outlook for the reminder for 2021. Nevertheless, uncertainties remain across many sectors, particularly the aviation sector, depending on the extent of COVID-19 containment measures and how fast the herd immunity targets are reached. Developments in the overall economy and positive progress in the labor market will provide an upward momentum to the outlook, particularly for the recovery in gasoline demand. In 2021, gasoline and diesel demand are anticipated to see a rise, as well as light distillates, on the back of a healthy petrochemical sector. Conversely, efficiency gains and substitution programs are assumed to limit demand for oil petroleum product demand in the transportation sector. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments Oil demand in OECD Europe showed a drop of 1.8 mb/d y-o-y in February 2021 following a 2.4 mb/d y-o-y fall in January. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in February 2019, oil demand showed a decrease of 1.6 mb/d.

Similar trends can be observed in road transportation fuels. Despite improving m-o-m mobility indicators, 0 February showed a remarkable decrease when compared to pre-pandemic levels. This has impacted on-road diesel and gasoline consumption which -2 shrunk by around 1.0 mb/d y-o-y cumulatively.

Demand for petrochemical feedstock was supported by steady demand for plastics in the healthcare sector and for packaging materials. Expansion in steam-cracking capacity also supported demand. Fuel oil demand increased marginally in February, while the decline in industrial diesel improved to 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in February, from a nearly 0.4 mb/d y-o-y drop in January. Industrial production (excluding construction), as reported by Eurostat and Haver Analytics, dropped to 103.8 in February compared to 104.7 in January. In terms of individual countries, Germany’s oil demand recovered the most, with a decline of 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in February compared to a more than 0.5 mb/d y-o-y drop in January.

Near-term expectations Going forward, the distorted level of consumption from March 2020 onward will likely show positive demand growth for the rest of 2021. Hence, oil demand in OECD Europe is projected to flip to growth in 2Q21 but remains categorized as weak when compared to pre-CODID-19 levels. Furthermore, uncertainties surrounding the outlook are unusually high despite a pickup in vaccination programs. COVID-19 third waves in many countries in the region have entailed full and partial shutdowns of businesses and daily activities. For the 2H21, oil demand projections account for a strong rebound in OECD Europe economic activities, supported by stimulus programs and an uptick in the speed of the vaccination rollout leading to a steady acceleration in industrial production, and improved mobility. Subsequently, demand is anticipated to increase steadily in 2021 driven by transportation fuels, coming from a low base in 2020, and by industrial fuels, in main consuming countries in the region. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments Despite oil demand flipping to growth in Japan and Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y South Korea, oil demand in OECD Asia Pacific change continued to show a decline in February 2021, mainly mb/d due to steep drops in Australian oil requirements. 0.8 Oil demand fell by a marginal 0.04 mb/d, y-o-y, in 0.4 OECD Asia Pacific compared to a much larger decline in January of more than 0.5 mb/d, y-o-y.

This increase is based on assumptions of lower demand recorded in 2020 and an improving GDP outlook. Uncertainties are still high – especially related to the COVID-19 infection numbers and the vaccination rollouts – and will affect oil demand projections especially in 2Q21. At the same time, the recent resurgence in COVID-19 infection cases in Japan is assumed to marginally impact fuel consumption in the 2Q21 compared to last month’s assessment. For the 2H21, the outlook for oil demand will benefit from healthy consumption of petrochemical feedstock and developing industrial activity compared to last year. For transportation fuels, gasoline will be on the path of recovery supported by increased mobility while jet fuel requirements in the aviation sector will be impacted by a reduced level of international business and leisure travel.

Diesel also posted strong gains of over 0.5 mb/d, y-o-y, in March, although lower than the growth posted in February of around 0.8 mb/d, y-o-y. Those increases were driven by steady developments in manufacturing activities with the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI registering 50.6 in March, following 50.9 in February. On the other hand, services PMI increased to a three-month high of 54.3 in March following 51.5 in February, driven by domestic demand, with new orders growing the most since December of last year. Jet fuel demand in March rose by 0.5 mb/d, y-o-y, after gaining 0.3 mb/d, y-o-y, in February as domestic flights returned to pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, international flight operations remained nearly 60% below pre-COVID-19 levels, a considerable hurdle for a full recovery in jet fuel demand.

Sources: JODI, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India and OPEC. Near-term expectations India’s 2Q21 oil demand is projected to be impacted be the recent surge in COVID-19 infection cases. Recent mobility data show weakness in performance towards the end of April and this is anticipated to last well into the month of May and possibly June putting the whole 2Q21 oil demand performance in check. However, some support might emerge from increased usage of private vehicles over public transportation which could cap declines in transportation fuels demand. While 2Q21 product demand has been adjusted lower than previously anticipated, projections will depend on many factors that will affect the magnitude of the impact on the demand. These include government containment measures which are projected to be localised and targeting specific regions, the speed of vaccination rollouts and their positive impact on reducing hospitalization and death rates, and lastly how quickly the population will adapt to COVID-19 measures. At the same time, anticipated positive developments in the economic outlook, especially in 2H21, and the consequent improvement in several sectors, primarily transportation and industrial sectors, point to solid growth in oil demand in 2021. This forecast is based on the assumption of a positive baseline impact of 2020, stimulus measures taken by the government to encourage private consumption and investment, and a pickup in vaccination rollouts towards the 2H21. However, uncertainties will remain high especially in the 2Q21 due to COVID-19 related developments. Latin America Update on the latest developments In February 2021, oil demand shrunk by more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in Latin America, after posting similar drops in January. Transportation fuels are the main cause of the decline amid restriction policies to control the high spread of COVID-19 cases in various countries in the region. Jet fuel and gasoline continued declining largely due to a reduction in mobility. Transportation fuels registered a cumulative drop of 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, in February compared to a decline of around 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in January. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Oil Demand In terms of countries, demand declined the most in Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y Brazil, falling around 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in February. change Most of the decline was due to slower transportation mb/d requirements as both gasoline and jet fuel fell y-o-y. 0.9 The Government’s decision to delay this year's 0.6 carnival festivities together with COVID-19 containment measures in certain parts of the country 0.3 contributed to the decline. 0.0 Consequently, both fuels dropped by a combined -0.3 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in February, following a decline of -0.6 around 0.05 mb/d in January. Additionally, vehicle -0.9 registrations showed a decrease of around 17.0% -1.2 y-o-y in February, lower than the 11.9% y-o-y drop recorded in January.

Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: JODI, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis and OPEC. Near-term expectations For 2Q21, oil demand is estimated to be under pressure owing to rising COVID-19 infection cases in Brazil, Peru and Colombia, and given the potential need for larger scale lockdowns coupled with the high uncertainty regarding economic developments, particularly Brazil’s. As a result, transportation fuels led by gasoline and jet fuel will face difficulties in returning to growth in the 2Q21. Diesel and fuel oil consumption are projected to show signs of improvement most likely towards the 2H21. In 2H21, oil demand is estimated to gain momentum on the back of a recovering economy and low base line of comparison in 2020. Furthermore, the considerable uncertainties will remain skewed to the downside, particularly due to issues related to COVID-19 cases, vaccination programs and the possible appearance of new variants. On the economic front, government stimulus measures, high unemployment, and currency challenges are issues to monitor closely going forward. In terms of countries, Brazil is anticipated to provide support to the oil demand recovery in 2021, as transportation fuel demand is projected to pick up pace in the 2H21. From a products point of view, diesel and transportation fuels are projected to lead growth in 2021. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 35 World Oil Demand Middle East Update on the latest developments Oil demand in the Middle East declined by 0.3 mb/d, Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change y-o-y, in February 2021, following a drop of more than mb/d 0.5 mb/d, y-o-y, in January. The contraction in oil 1.0 requirements in February 2021 is 0.5 mb/d lower than February 2019 level. Sluggish improvements in 0.5 mobility, social distancing policies, and a trend toward home schooling and teleworking have all contributed 0.0 negatively to oil demand performance in the Middle -0.5 East in February. In terms of countries, Saudi Arabia and Iraq accounted for most of the y-o-y declines as -1.0 both countries dropped 0.4 mb/d y-o-y. On the product side, gasoline, jet fuel and diesel led the declines in -1.5 the region falling by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y collectively, after posting matching declines in 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* January. Note: * 1Q21-4Q21 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. Despite some improvement in mobility in the region, gasoline demand continued to decline y-o-y, largely due reduced mobility compared to the same period in 2019. The policy of home schooling in Saudi Arabia, for example, remained in place adversely impacting demand for gasoline in the country. Jet fuel fell y-o-y as the reduction in international flights continued in February, limiting jet fuel demand. Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand is estimated to pick up pace in 2Q21 and show increases y-o-y. These increases are projected to last until year-end, propelled by the steep decline in demand in 2020. Easing restriction measures are accounted for in the current outlook which in turn will provide support to transportation fuel demand. However, it is worth mentioning that the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 infection cases is still high which might slow the recovery process especially in the 2Q21. As mentioned in last month’s MOMR, Saudi Arabia’s PMI showed steady growth in non-oil private sectors, despite dropping to 53.3 in March from 53.9 in February reflecting the impact of a new wave of COVID-19 infections. This in turn will impact 2Q21 industrial fuel demand. Effective COVID-19 vaccination programs in addition to the recovery in oil prices will provide an upside potential to oil demand. Furthermore, progress in infrastructure projects and an uptick in power generation requirements should also support the expected upside momentum. On the other hand, any additional measures in response to a strong wave of COVID-19 infection cases will provide a downside risk to oil demand in the near term. In the Middle East region as a whole, relaxation in restriction measures are estimated to support overall oil demand, especially for gasoline and industrial fuels. 36 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2020 is estimated to have declined by 2.52 mb/d y-o-y to average 62.89 mb/d. US crude and condensate output declined by 0.9 mb/d y-o-y to average 11.3 mb/d, while liquids production dropped by 0.8 mb/d y-o-y to average 17.62 mb/d. Oil supply also declined in Russia by 1.0 mb/d, to average 10.59 mb/d. Moreover, production declined in Canada, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil supply is estimated to have increased in Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana. Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2021 was revised down this month by 0.23 mb/d to average 63.60 mb/d, mainly due to the huge outages of 2.2 mb/d in US liquids production in February, following the drastic freeze in Texas and elsewhere, and is now forecast to grow by 0.70 mb/d y-o-y. Moreover, the supply forecast in Norway was also revised down by 0.08 mb/d due to large outages because of seasonal maintenance in 2Q and 3Q21. The main drivers for supply growth for 2021 are expected to be Canada, Brazil, China, and Norway, while the US will decline by 0.07 mb/d, y-o-y. Investment in exploration and production (E&P) in the oil and gas sector of non-OPEC countries is most likely to remain flat y-o-y at $311 billion because many projects were delayed or put on hold from last year and US shale producers continue to demonstrate spending discipline. E&P investment declined in 2020 by 29%, similar to declines in 2015 and 2016 of 28% and 27%, when North Sea Dated collapsed from an average of $99/b in 2014 to around $52/b and $44/b, respectively. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2020 is estimated to have declined by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y at 5.13 mb/d. For 2021, OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.21 mb/d. OPEC crude oil production in April was up by 0.03 mb/d m-o-m to average 25.08 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Non-OPEC liquids output including OPEC NGLs in April fell by 0.18 mb/d m-o-m to average 67.97 mb/d, down by 1.16 mb/d, y-o-y. As a result, global oil supply decreased in April by 0.15 mb/d m-o-m to average 93.06 mb/d, down by 6.45 mb/d y-o-y.

At the same time, the Dakota Access pipeline will not be forced to shut down while federal regulators conduct new environmental analysis. The Biden Administration’s decision to allow the line to keep operating is a victory for its pipeline owner Energy Transfer LP and drillers such as Continental Resources that use it to transport crude from North Dakota’s Bakken oil field. Looking forward, Rystad Energy forecast oil production in the Bakken to decline for a seventh straight month to 1.083 mb/d in May. Following a decline of 0.92 mb/d y-o-y in 2020, US crude oil production in 2021 is forecast to decline by 0.28 mb/d y-o-y to average 11.04 mb/d. Production from the GoM is expected to grow by 0.06 mb/d to average 1.71 mb/d, while onshore conventional crude is estimated to decline by 0.05 mb/d to average 2.29 mb/d, largely due to mature oil fields.

It seems that operators are able to profitably drill a new well across major US onshore basins at current oil prices. In terms of the major basins, in the week ended 30 April, 224 oil rigs were active in the Permian Basin, down by 2 rigs w-o-w, but up by 5 rigs, y-o-y. At the same time, the number of active oil rigs in the Eagle Ford Basin was 34, up by 4, y-o-y. The Williston Basin reported 15 active oil rigs, still down by 11 y-o-y, and finally 7 units were reported in the DJ-Niobrara Basin, the same level as a year ago. With regard to spudding, completion and started Graph 5 9: Spudded, completed and started wells wells in all US shale plays, as reported by Rystad in the US shale plays Energy, 469 horizontal wells were spudded in April (as Wells per preliminary information), down by 16, m-o-m, but 1,000 higher by 56% from 301 wells a year earlier.

Rystad Energy Permian Midland Permian Delaware estimates the number of started fracking jobs per DJ Basin Eagle Ford month in April to be lower by about 7%, m-o-m. Bakken Others Sources: Rystad Energy Shale Well Cube and OPEC. Outside of the Permian, the largest growth comes from south Texas’ Eagle Ford, where 87 frac jobs have been detected in April as of now, compared to 67 in March. Hence, the full count for April is set to substantially exceed the total for March. Overall US operations were characterized by significant median productivity improvements in 3Q21 Increased fracking would likely help sustain US onshore production as operators bring online their drilled, but uncompleted (DUC) wells. With the strong rebound in US oil fracking activity since the winter slowdown in February, the DUC inventory in major tight oil regions (Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara and Anadarko) saw another month of strong declines in March and April. Total horizontal DUCs inventory in oil regions declined to about 4,700 wells in March, as fracking outpaced drilling by approximately 160 wells. Out of the 4,700 wells, almost 1,900 consist of so-called dead DUCs – wells drilled more than two years ago – which remain in an uncompleted state. “Historically, we note that DUCs rarely contribute to frac activity after an initial period of 18-24 months, though occasional completions still occur on a small percentage of wells drilled more than two years earlier” according to Rystad Energy. There has been a m-o-m drop in the number of DUCs in US shale plays since July 2020. This continued in April with a drop of 460 wells m-o-m, to stand at 2,264 uncompleted wells. Since June 2020, when the DUC count peaked, 1,570 DUCs have been completed and put on production by the end of April.

Alberta Health Services reported more than 700 active Covid-19 cases as of 26 April, the same day that municipal authorities in Northern Alberta declared a state of emergency. Major mining projects – including Canadian Natural Resources’ (CNRL) Horizon mine and upgrader, Suncor’s base mine, and the Syncrude Mildred Lake site – accounted for over 85% of active cases. In response to the rising infections, Suncor announced plans to shift maintenance at its Base Mine’s U2 upgrader to June 2021. The turnaround was originally scheduled to begin in May and was estimated to pull an average of 130 tb/d of synthetic crude oil off-line in 2Q21. Similarly, Syncrude began maintenance on its 350 tb/d upgrader in April, although work was extended further into the summer. Rystad Energy reprots expected extended maintenance to include outages of 358 tb/d in 2Q21, nearly 120 tb/d in 3Q21 and 60 tb/d in 4Q21, mainly due to scheduled maintenance at Syncrude and the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP), which could take nearly 200 tb/d off-line in October 2021. Following heavy declines in Canada’s oil production in 2020 due to shut-in wells by 0.24 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.17 mb/d, Canadian oil supply is forecast to grow by 0.28 mb/d y-o-y in 2021, revised down by 24 tb/d to average 5.46 mb/d. 44 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Oil Supply Mexico Mexico’s liquids output in March was up by Graph 5 14: Mexico’s monthly liquids and crude 0.02 mb/d m-o-m to average 1.94 mb/d.

Lower crude production is forecast for 2Q21 and 3Q21,due to lower volumes of crude transferred by the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) as a shutdown is scheduled to extend for around 20 days from 27 May. Moreover, exports of the UK's Brent crude stream, one of the five grades that underpin the North Sea Dated benchmark, could be disrupted by a strike at the Sullom Voe onshore oil processing and a storage terminal on the Shetland Islands in May. However, production is projected to rise to 1.04 mb/d in 4Q21, not only because of the full return of Forties, but also owing to new production from the Columbus project which is planned to start-up in 4Q21 as well as the Buzzard phase-2 project. UK oil supply in 2020 is estimated to have declined by 0.07mb/d to average 1.07 mb/d. For 2021, UK oil production is anticipated to decline, due to a COVID-19 induced investment crunch. Following a decrease of 32% in investment last year in the oil and gas sector to average $5.7bn, several E&P projects have reportedly been deferred, such as the Seagull project, which was deferred to late 2022. Hence, UK oil supply is expected to decline by 0.05 mb/d y-o-y to average 1.02 mb/d.

The last time when crude production was higher than 4 mb/d was in June 2016 at 4.04 mb/d. Liquids output in 1Q21 increased by 164 tb/d q-o-q to average 4.25 mb/d, while crude oil output increased by 126 tb/d in the same period. The difference of 38 tb/d is due to higher NGLs output by 14 tb/d to average 0.2 mb/d in 1Q21, and increasing non-conventional liquids such as ethanol, biodiesel, and CTL, which totalled 0.24 mb/d in 1Q21. According to the news about well blowout and fire on a platform in Bohai Bay in early April, oil production has partially halted at China's largest offshore oilfield. It is estimated that the impact of the incident at the wellhead platform in the Penglai 19-3 field on CNOOC Ltd's annual production is up to approximately 600 tb of oil. Hence, this will impact oil production in April. Nevertheless, China’s liquids production will grow by 0.09 mb/d y-o-y in 2021, revised up due to stronger-than-expected oil output in 1Q21, which is carried over to 2Q21 and 3Q21.

Latin America Latin America’s total liquids supply in March was up by 0.02 mb/d m-o-m to average 5.95 mb/d, down by 0.31 mb/d y-o-y in all countries of the region, except Guyana. Total liquids supply in the region for 2020 is estimated to have declined by 0.03 mb/d to average 6.06 mb/d. This is mainly due to lower-than-expected output following the shut in of wells on the back of COVID-19 and a slowdown in drilling and operations, as well as prolonged maintenance in Brazil. Liquids production in 2020 is estimated to have grown in Brazil by 0.12 mb/d to average 3.68 mb/d and in Guyana by 0.07 mb/d to average 0.07 mb/d. Meanwhile, oil production in other countries in the region declined. For 2021, oil production is projected to grow by 0.23 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.28 mb/d, revised down by 8 tb/d, m-o-m. Oil production in Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, Argentina and Peru is forecast to increase, owing to production ramp-ups in fields that started in 2019 and 2020. Production in Ecuador is projected to recover by 0.06 mb/d from outages seen in 2020 to average 0.55 mb/d. Oil production is likely to decline in Colombia by a minor 0.01 mb/d.

Production of crude oil is expected to increase in the coming quarters, mainly due to the ramp-up of the Atapu, Berbigao and Sururu fields. It is worth noting that the initial production forecast for this year has been impacted by the mandated health protection measures by Petrobras in its platforms. Production was temporarily reduced at the Marlim Sul offshore field due to COVID-19-related safety measures, as well as prolonged and unforeseen maintenance weighing on oil production in 1Q21. Brazilian oil and gas giant Petrobras has revealed that the first production from its Mero 1, through the FPSO Guanabara, has been postponed due to delays in FPSO construction. Petrobras announced in the first week of April that the production expected to start from Mero 1 was postponed from 4Q21 to 1Q22. Moreover, the 50 tb/d Peregrino phase 2 project in Campos Basin which is planned to come onstream in 1H21, has also been delayed to 2022. Total pre-salt production in March reached 2.1 mb/d, 74% of total crude output in March, mainly from Tupi and Búzios fields in Santos Basin. Production of NGLs was almost flat in March since December 2020, to average 0.1 mb/d and is expected to have remained flat in April. According to official data, biofuels production has been flat since January at an average 614 tb/d, and preliminary data shows that it remained flat in April. In March, Brazil liquids production, including biofuels, was up by 0.03 mb/d, m-o-m, to average 3.56 mb/d. In 2020, liquids production in Brazil grew by by 0.12 mb/d, of which crude oil increased by 155 tb/d y-o-y. For 2021, liquids supply is forecast to grow further by0.13 mb/d, if all fields are fully ramped up, and average 3.81 mb/d. This is a downward revision of 14 tb/d m-o-m due to lower than expected production in 1Q21 by 55 tb/d. Brazil’s oil production will be boosted through the FPSO Carioca, which is estimated to come online in 2H21 at the Sepia field, offshore Brazil. The FPSO Carioca will be installed in a water depth of 2,140 m and has a capacity to produce 180 tb/d of crude oil and 212 mscf/d of gas.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Product Markets and Refinery Operations In April, refinery margins further extended the same trends witnessed in the previous month, with positive performances only manifested in the Atlantic Basin. In the USGC, margins jumped, while in Europe, they rose only moderately, as product markets continued to benefit from the recent rise in unplanned outages recorded in the previous month in the US as well as low refinery output levels due to heavy maintenance. This led to a tighter overall product balance and positive product market sentiment, which helped keep fuel prices sustained. On the other hand, margins in Asia performed negatively as refining economics showed losses with pressure coming mainly from the mid-section of the barrel, as the market there remained well supplied. Refinery margins USGC refining margins increased slightly as support Graph 6 1: Refining margins derived from exports and further improvements in US$/b US$/b domestic mobility indicators helped support product 15 15 markets. In addition, the positive impact on refining margins at the start of the month caused by product 10 10 tightness due to the recent peak maintenance season 5 5 added to the support, particularly to complex configurations.

US refinery margins for WTI averaged $12.83/b in April, up by 15¢ m-o-m and by 91¢ y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe increased and showed the strongest positive response compared to the other key regions as gasoline crack spreads continued to soar, reaching the highest level recorded since October 2019. Additional support stemmed from the gasoil and jet fuel segments as refinery outputs for these products remained restrained due to the recent heavy maintenance works. Strict lockdown measures continued to exert pressure over European product markets and likely kept gains in refining economics capped. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $2.72/b in April, up by $1.34 compared with a month earlier but down by $2.83 y-o-y. In Asia, margins weakened further, with most of the pressure coming from the bottom of the barrel, although crude processing rates in the region remained relatively constrained. Prevailing ample product availability amid weaker waning product export requirements from Asia as refiners are returning from major turnarounds in other regions prevented any upside in Asian product markets. Overall Asian offline refining capacity in the region rose in April, while, at the same time, infection rates for the new COVID variant surged in India, triggering re-implementation and re-enforcement of restriction measures within the region. India’s Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals was reported to have reduced refinery intakes as the pandemic wave weighs on fuel consumption levels. The company reduced its refining capacity by 15% to 1.1 million tonnes in April with further downside risk for India refinery intakes seeming very likely in the near term. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia lost 30¢ m-o-m to average $1.65/b in April, which was higher by $3.74 y-o-y. 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased in March to average 78.28%, which corresponds to a throughput of 13.22 mb/d.

The US gasoline crack spreads gained $1.42 m-o-m to average $25.40 in March, down by $2.49/b y-o-y. The USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads maintained the ground gained in the previous month in line with steady improvement in domestic air travel although business and international flights remain subdued. The improvement in jet/kerosene markets was also partially attributed to a 1.5 mb decline over the first half of April as reduction in intakes in the previous month led to lower jet/kerosene availability and supported crack spreads. Going forward, the conclusion of heavy maintenance works should weaken the supply side support, which could challenge the positive impact from projections of stronger air travel activities as the weather gets warmer. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $8.48/b, up by 70¢ m-o-m, but marginally down by 6¢ y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI were pressured by ample product availability as stocks built up for four consecutive weeks in early April and triggered less positive market sentiment. In addition, while gasoil exports from Europe to Latin America remained strong, a closed arbitrage for gasoil deliveries to Europe in light of movement restrictions there exacerbated the negative impact on gasoil margins. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $4.25/b, down by 29 ¢ m-o-m and by $4.27 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 53 Product Markets and Refinery Operations US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI remained nearly unchanged for the second consecutive month, affected by the recent maintenance works at secondary processing units and ample fuel oil availability in the country. In April, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $4.24/b, remaining flat m-o-m but was down by $10.12 y-o-y. European market Gasoline crack spreads soared as gasoline prices in Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent April continued to rise, and kept its position at preUS$/b US$/b pandemic levels backed by limited supplies following 20 20 turnarounds amid firm exports to West Africa.

The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $4.19/b, up by $1.09 m-o-m but down by 22¢ y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads moved upwards, albeit to a limited extent, in line with significant improvements in mobility activity as truck movements recovered in Germany. Moreover, additional support emerged from Poland, where mobility levels rose considerably relative to February levels, despite some downside derived from mostly diesel-fuelled Turkey, where rising infection rates have forced the government to introduce a full lockdown. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $5.12/b, which was higher by 75¢ m-o-m but lower by $9.17 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads reversed trend and lost ground, pressured by weaker fundamentals as absorption levels from within the region declined amid strong volume arrivals from Russia. Going forward, the gradual return of distillation capacity in Europe is set to contribute to higher fuel oil availability, which could exert pressure on the economics of simple refinery configurations, while refineries with conversion capacity can benefit from fuel oil conversion. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $8.56/b in April, having lost 31¢ m-o-m and $5.23 y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92-crack spread jumped, Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai extending the upward trend for the fifth consecutive US$/b US$/b month, boosted by robust gasoline exports to other 10 10 regions.

Seasonal naphtha demand is relatively low due to regular steam cracker maintenance and has been further pressured by an unexpected slowdown of PTTGC’s Map Ta Phut in Thailand steam crackers due to problems with power supply, according to Argus Media. Japan has been increasingly importing naphtha over the last few months, with February and March imports averaging around 140,000 b/d (35%) higher than in 2020, and over 100,000 b/d (27%) higher vs 2020 in April. Going forward, Asian naphtha markets are expected to remain well supported by the petrochemical industry with the conclusion of steam cracker maintenance. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged $1.02/b, having decreased by 5¢ m-o-m, but increased by $2.71 y-o-y. In the middle of the barrel, the jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia reversed trend, moving upwards due to stronger regional requirements for domestic air travel. However, the majority of international flights remain suspended due to prolonged border restrictions amid outbreaks of the new COVID variant in many parts of Asia, while business travel is still being avoided as much as possible. Jet fuel supplies in the region are limited as refiners have kept a cap on production due to weaker refining margins. The end of the winter season in Northeast Asia and subsequent decline in kerosene consumption for heating could weigh further on jet/kerosene markets in the near term. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged minus $0.52/b, down by $1.06 m-o-m and $2.95 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spreads weakened, supported by limited regional supplies as well as healthy domestic absorption levels backed by strong economic and industrial activities in the region. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $4.81/b, up by $0.46/b m-o-m but down by $2.71 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spreads continued to trend downwards, heading deeper into negative territory to reach the lowest level seen since June 2020. The poor performance was attributed to stronger availability and moderate regional fuel oil demand. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $5.84/b, down by 41¢ m-o-m and by $6.74 y-o-y.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 57 Tanker Market Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates declined in April, as the improvement seen in March in the Suezmax and Aframax classes proved temporary and VLCCs rates moved sideways. Rates fell as gains in the Atlantic Basin triggered by the fallout from the February big freeze in the US Gulf Coast (USGC) unwound. Clean rates rose across the board, except on the NWE-to-US East Coast (USEC) route, where rates fell back from the relatively strong levels seen in the prior two months. Dirty tanker rates are not expected to pick up until 2H21 or 2022, with the latter date more likely. The outlook for clean rates, however, is slightly more positive. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in April, falling by almost 2.0 mb/d, or over 12%, to average 14.3 mb/d. Spot fixtures were around 6.5 mb/d, or 31%, lower than the same month last year. The decline came amid continued sluggish tanker demand due to an ongoing destocking globally, and as tanker availability remained high amid lower-than-expected scrapping.

OPEC spot fixtures fell m-o-m in April, down by almost 1.0 mb/d, or 9%, to average 9.59 mb/d. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were over 34% lower, down by 4.9 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-West provided a bright note, averaging 1.0 mb/d in April, representing a jump of close to 43% m-o-m, or 0.3 mb/d. Y-o-y, the route saw a decline of 1.9 mb/d, or almost 65%, from the strong levels seen in April 2020. Separate Vortexa data shows the m-o-m increase was driven by flows to the US Gulf that grew sharply in March and April ahead of the driving season and as flows to the Med remained high relative to recent months. Middle East-to-East fixtures fell by 15%, or more than 0.9 mb/d m-o-m, to average around 5.2 mb/d. This was almost 3.0 mb/d, or 37%, lower than in the same month last year. Outside Middle East fixtures fell by almost 0.3 mb/d, or close to 9% m-o-m, to average 3.4 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were down by just over 2%, or less than 0.1 mb/d. Sailings and arrivals Sailings were broadly unchanged in April from the previous month, with OPEC sailings averaging 21.5 mb/d. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings were down 4.0 mb/d, or almost 16%. Middle East sailings edged marginally higher, averaging 15.6 mb/d. Y-o-y, sailings from the region were down 3.2 mb/d, or 17%, compared with the same month last year. Crude arrivals were higher m-o-m on all routes in April, except in Europe. Arrivals in West Asia rose 0.2 mb/d, or close to 4%, to average 6.4 mb/d. Y-o-y, West Asia arrivals were 2.1 mb/d, or 47%, higher. Arrivals in the Far East increased 0.5 mb/d, or just under 5%, to average 12.4 mb/d. This was 4.3 mb/d, or 53%, higher than the same month last year. Arrivals in North America averaged 8.4 mb/d, representing a gain of 0.3 mb/d, or around 4%, and a 0.5 mb/d, or over 6%, increase y-o-y. 58 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Tanker Market Table 7 2: Tanker sailings and arrivals, mb/d Change Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 Apr 21/Mar 21 Sailings OPEC 20.13 21.46 21.47 0.01 Middle East 14.98 15.55 15.56 0.01 Arrivals North America 8.07 8.06 8.35 0.29 Europe 10.98 11.88 11.85 -0.03 Far East 12.48 11.87 12.41 0.54 West Asia 5.51 6.21 6.44 0.23 Sources: Oil Movements and OPEC. Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates remain at low levels, despite rising 5% m-o-m. They are 77% lower than the same month last year, when a surge of supply onto the market swept up tanker availability and pushed rates to multi-year highs. The improvement came amid higher flows to Asia targeting the end of maintenance, as well as higher flows on VLCCs to North America and Europe to a lesser extent, as these markets are seeing signs of a recovery from COVID-19 impacts. Ample availability, however, capped gains. Rates on the Middle East-to-East route led gains, increasing 11% m-o-m to average WS34 points. Y-o-y, rates were 78% below the same month last year. Higher rates were supported by an increase in flows to China and South Korea, offsetting declines in Japan and India, according to Vortexa data. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route edged up 3% m-o-m to average WS23 points in April. Y-o-y, rates were 78% lower. The increase in rates were driven by a jump in departures to the USGC, which expanded sharply for the second month. The West Africa-to-East route remained flat m-o-m in April at WS36. Rates were 76% lower compared with April 2020. The sluggish performance came amid lower demand for VLCC flows to India and Thailand.

Aframax After an improved performance in March, Aframax rates declined by 27% m-o-m in April. This was 44% lower than the same month last year. The declines came as upward pressure on rates from disruptions in the USGC dissipated.

The biggest decline was in the Caribbean-to-USEC route, which dropped 34% m-o-m to average WS91. Y-o-y, rates on the route were 40% lower. Med routes also experienced strong declines m-o-m in April, after increasing over the first quarter of this year. Both routes declined 30%, with the Mediterranean-to-Northwest Europe (NWE) route averaging WS85 and the Cross-Med route averaging WS87.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 61 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade US crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d m-o-m in April, to average 6.0 mb/d, the highest in 10 months, according to preliminary data. US crude exports declined to their lowest since December 2018, averaging 2.6 mb/d. US product imports remained near a 19-month high, while product exports rose to the highest since the freeze in February disrupted USGC refineries. For the coming months, the US is seen as a key driver behind a continued improvement in trade momentum. Moreover, the pace and timing of crude exports is likely to have an impact on market rebalancing. In China, crude imports remained near a four-month high in March, averaging 11.7 mb/d. Product exports continued moving higher, reaching a 10-month high of 1.7 mb/d, driven by a strong performance from gasoil and jet. China’s crude imports are expected to ease in 2Q21 from the current high levels, as refinery maintenance slows requirements. Preliminary data for April reflects this, showing crude imports falling to 9.9 mb/d. Product exports are likely to ease on a combination of lower outputs due to maintenance and improving domestic demand. India’s crude imports fell to a five-month low in March, averaging 4.3 mb/d. India’s product imports slipped further, while product exports jumped 32% m-o-m in March, driven by strong outflows of gasoil. In the nearterm, the destabilizing surge in COVID cases in the country is likely to curtail crude and product imports, and could result in increased product exports in efforts to manage high inventory levels. Japan’s crude imports declined in March after three months of healthy levels supported by winter demand. Product imports dropped back from a three-year high, averaging 1.1 mb/d. While supportive of the market in recent months, inflows of crude and products are likely to ease in the near-term with the end of winter heating demand, the start of the regional refinery maintenance season and renewed lockdowns due to COVID-19. The latest data for OECD Europe show crude imports declined 0.2 mb/d m-o-m in January to 7.8 mb/d. Crude exports averaged 0.8 mb/d, the highest since 2006, with increased exports from Norway and the UK heading primarily to China. Product imports recovered some of the previous month’s losses, with diesel and jet leading gains. More recent estimates show continued strong crude exports in 1Q21 and a pickup in crude imports at the start of 2Q21 as demand picks up amid an easing outlook on lockdowns. US Preliminary data shows that US crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d m-o-m, or 4%, in April to average 6.0 mb/d, the highest in 10 months. The gains were a continuation of the recovery from disruptions caused by the severe winter weather in February, and supported by positive momentum from the easing of the impacts of COVID-19. Crude imports were more than 8%, or 0.5 mb/d, higher compared to the same month last year.

Crude exports were 0.4 mb/d lower, or 15%, compared with the same month last year. It is likely that crude outflows will see upward momentum in the coming months as more crude becomes available amid a return of activity following the February disruptions. 62 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination shows generally lower flows to the Asian region in February. China’s purchases of US crude averaged 0.3 mb/d in January, compared to 0.4 mb/d the month before. Over the same period, crude exports to India and South Korea were each around 0.1 mb/d lower, averaging 0.5 mb/d and 0.2 mb/d, respectively. Separate customs data for March points to South Korea boosting inflows to 0.4 mb/d to become the top destination for the month, followed by India with 0.3 mb/d. In April, exports to the Netherlands jumped to 0.5 mb/d from 0.1 mb/d in March. US net crude imports averaged 3.4 mb/d in April, compared to 3.0 mb/d the month before and 2.4 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US product imports remained steady near a 19-month high in April averaging 2.5 mb/d. This represents a negligible decline of 32 tb/d m-o-m and a gain of 0.8 mb/d over the same month last year. These levels were a continuation of the high flows from Europe triggered by US weather disruptions in February. US product exports recovered in April from the lows seen over the previous two months, averaging 5.1 mb/d in April, representing an almost 12% increase over the previous month. The improvement in flows reflected the return of normal distillate trade flows that had been disrupted by the February freeze. Y-o-y, however, product exports were still 0.3 mb/d, or 5%, lower than the same month last year. As a result, US net product exports averaged 2.6 mb/d in April, compared with an exceptionally low 2.0 mb/d the month before and 3.7 mb/d in April 2020. Preliminary data indicates that the US remained a net crude and product importer in April, with net inflows of almost 0.8 mb/d. This compares with net imports of almost 0.9 mb/d the month before and net exports of 1.2 mb/d in April 2020.

Compared to the same month last year, imports were 2.0 mb/d higher, or up almost 21%. Preliminary customs data for April show imports averaged 9.9 mb/d as refiners entered the maintenance season and fell back on ample stocks due to a strong slate of imports from the first quarter. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia remained in the top position in March, with a share of almost 16%.

This is around 0.1 mb/d, or more than 10% lower, compared to the same month last year. Losses were driven by LPG and fuel oil. China’s product exports continued moving higher, reaching a 10-month high of 1.7 mb/d, driven by a strong performance from gasoil and jet. Compared to the previous month, product outflows were 0.2 mb/d, or 15%, higher. Y-o-y, product exports were lower by about 0.2 mb/d. Preliminary data shows product exports remained relatively level m-o-m in April amid lower refinery outputs and improving domestic demand. Taken together, China’s net product exports averaged 0.5 mb/d in March. This compares to net exports of only 38 tb/d the month before and 0.7 mb/d in the same month last year.

This was due to renewed COVID-19 impacts, as well as rising prices that weighed on demand for crude imports. Crude inflows were down 0.1 mb/d, or 3%, from the previous month. Compared to the same month last year, crude imports declined 0.3 mb/d or 6%. The latest available customs data shows Iraq remained the top crude exporter to India in February with a share of 23%, up from 19% in the prior month. UAE was second with 15%, followed by the United States with 14%, then Nigeria and Saudi Arabia with 11% each. Product imports slipped from the good showing the month before, averaging 1.1 mb/d. The declines were driven by lower LPG inflows. The total figures represent a 0.1 mb/d, or 8%, decline m-o-m, and a 55 tb/d, or 5% gain, y-o-y. Product exports showed a strong performance, increasing by almost 32% to average 1.5 mb/d in March, the highest in 11 months. All major products showed healthy gains, except jet fuel. The increases were driven by higher refinery runs along with strong demand in export markets, particularly Asia and the Middle East, amid lower availability from Europe and the Mediterranean.

Compared to the same month last year, crude inflows were 1.6 mb/d lower, or 17%. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 65 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude exports to the OECD Europe averaged 0.8 mb/d, the highest level since 2006, with increased exports from Norway supported by higher output from the Johan Sverdrup field. Crude inflows were up 91 tb/d m-o-m, or 12%, and 0.3 mb/d higher y-o-y, or 45%, with the latter reflecting Chinese refiners appetite for Norwegian grades amid higher output over the period. As a result, net crude imports averaged almost 7.0 mb/d in January, down from 7.3 mb/d the month before and 8.9 mb/d in the same month of 2020. On the product side, imports increased for the second month in a row, averaging 2.9 mb/d, representing a gain of 0.2 mb/d, or almost 8%. The rise was mainly driven by naphtha inflows. Y-o-y, OECD Europe product inflows declined 0.5 mb/d, or 15%.
