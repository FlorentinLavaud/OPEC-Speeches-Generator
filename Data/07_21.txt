The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) increased for the second-consecutive month in June, reaching its highest monthly average since October 2018. The ORB value rose $4.98 m-o-m, or 7.4%, to settle at an average of $71.89/b. Year-to-date (y-t-d), the ORB averaged $63.85/b, representing a gain of $24.64, or 62.9%, compared to the same month last year. In June, investors turned increasingly optimistic about the outlook for the oil demand recovery amid expectations for a tighter global oil market in 2H21. The ICE Brent front month rose $5.10 m-o-m in June, or 7.5%, to average $73.41/b, and NYMEX WTI increased $6.20, or 9.5%, m-o-m to average $71.35/b. Consequently, the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI spread narrowed by $1.10 m-o-m to average $2.06/b in June, its lowest level since October 2020. The backwardation structure of all three major oil benchmarks strengthened in June on a tightening outlook for oil supply and demand fundamentals in the coming months. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted bullish positions related to crude in June, particularly in WTI, as speculators focus on expectations for rising oil prices. World Economy The global economic growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 5.5%. In an initial assessment, global economic growth for 2022 is forecast at 4.1%. However, future global growth continues to be impacted by uncertainties, including the spread of COVID-19 variants and the pace of the global vaccine rollout. In addition, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with inflationary pressures and central bank responses, remain key factors that require close monitoring. Nevertheless, upside potential could materialize as ongoing containment COVID-19 measures in combination with additional fiscal and monetary stimulus could turn out to be more effective than envisaged, leading to further gains in consumption and investments. US economic growth in 2021 remains at 6.4%, followed by growth of 3.6% in 2022. The Euro-zone economic growth in 2021 remains at 4.1%, followed by growth of 3.0% in 2022. Similarly, Japan’s economic growth forecast remains at 2.8% for 2021, followed by growth of 2.0% in 2022. After an unchanged growth forecast of 8.5% in 2021, China’s economic growth forecast for 2022 stands at 6.3%. India’s 2021 growth forecast remains at 9.5%, followed by growth of 6.8% in 2022. Brazil’s growth forecast for 2021 was revised up to 3.2%, followed by growth of 2.5% in 2022. Russia’s forecast for 2021 remains at 3.0%, followed by growth of 2.3% in 2022. World Oil Demand World oil demand growth in 2021 is forecast at 6.0 mb/d, unchanged from last month’s assessment, although there have been some regional revisions. Total oil demand is projected to average 96.6 mb/d. The 1Q21 was revised lower, amid slower than anticipated demand in the main OECD consuming countries. This was counterbalanced by better-than-expected data from OECD Americas in 2Q21, which is now projected to last through the 3Q21. Solid expectations exist for global economic growth in 2022. These include improved containment of COVID-19, particularly in emerging and developing countries, which are forecast to spur oil demand to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2022. World oil demand is anticipated to rise by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y in 2022, while total world oil demand is projected to average 99.86 mb/d, with the 100 mb/d mark exceeded in 2H22. OECD oil demand is anticipated to increase by 1.5 mb/d, as OECD Americas is expected to rise firmly with US oil demand only marginally below 2019 levels, mainly due to lagging transportation fuel demand. Non-OECD oil demand is projected to show an increase of 1.8 mb/d, with gains in China and India exceeding pre-pandemic levels, supported by a respectable recovery in transportation fuels and firm industrial fuel demand, including petrochemical feedstock. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2021 is revised down by 0.03 mb/d, despite upward revisions to the US and Canada. Growth is now at 0.81 mb/d for an average of 63.8 mb/d. The preliminary US liquids production recovery in 2Q21 indicates an increase of 1 mb/d, q-o-q. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are expected to be Canada, China, Norway, Brazil and Guyana, with the US now expected to see y-o-y growth of 0.06 mb/d. The initial forecast for 2022 sees non-OPEC liquids supply growing by 2.1 mb/d, with a 1.1 mb/d expansion in in the OECD, 0.8 mb/d growth in the non-OECD and a 0.1 mb/d recovery in processing gains. At the same time, uncertainty remains high regarding financial and operational aspects of US production. OPEC NGLs are OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 and 2022 to average 5.2 mb/d and 5.3 mb/d, respectively. OPEC crude oil production in June increased m-o-m by 0.59 mb/d, to average 26.03 mb/d, according to available secondary sources. Product Markets and Refining Operations Refinery margins in all main trading hubs declined in June as refineries ramped up processing rates following peak spring refinery maintenance season, which led to stronger product availability. This led to a longer overall product balance, as product output outpaced fuel consumption recovery, weighing on product crack spreads. The ongoing vaccination rollout and optimism following the relaxation of lockdown measures in many countries, leading to expectations of higher fuel consumption levels going forward, contributed to the rise in refinery runs, which are expected to remain strong in the near term. Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates remained at depressed levels in June as ample tonnage availability and limited tanker demand continued to weigh on the market. The search for better rates have even encouraged the use of new built VLCCs to carry clean products, eroding clean tanker rates. New deliveries, minimal scrapping and weak tanker demand point to a continued sluggish tanker market, possibly into next year. Crude and Refined Products Trade The US provided key seasonal support for global trade flows in June, according to preliminary data. US crude imports rose 0.7 mb/d m-o-m, or more than 11%, to average 6.7 mb/d in June, the highest since December 2019. US crude exports also rose sharply m-o-m in June, jumping 0.8 mb/d or almost 30%, to average 3.6 mb/d, the second-highest on record. China’s crude oil imports averaged 9.7 mb/d in May, representing a further decline of 0.2 mb/d or 2% m-o-m and a cumulative decline of 2.1 mb/d or 18% over the last two months. Preliminary figures for June show the country’s crude imports ticking up, but remaining below 10 mb/d. India’s crude imports fell to a seven-month low in May, as the peak of the second COVID-19 wave arrived in the middle of that the month. With reduced COVID-19 infections at the end of June, refiners in India have begun began to slowly lift run rates which could strengthen crude inflows in July. Meanwhile, Japan’s crude imports fell back in May from the strong levels seen the month before, averaging 2.4 mb/d, as renewed lockdown measures undermined expectations for product demand. The start of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in July should provide some boost to crude and product imports, although uncertainty regarding COVID-19 measures are clouding product needs. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary May data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks up by 8.3 mb m-o-m. At 2,934 mb, inventories were 276.9 mb lower than the same month last year; 86.6 mb lower than the latest five-year average; and 21.7 mb below the 2015-2019 average. Within components, crude and product stocks were up by 1.1 mb and 7.2 mb, respectively. At 1,466 mb, OECD crude stocks stood 60.8 mb below the latest five-year average and 32.5 mb below the 2015-2019 average. At 1,468 mb, OECD product stocks were 25.9 mb below the latest five-year average, but 10.8 mb above the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks fell 0.8 days m-o-m in May to stand at 64.2 days. This is 13.4 days below the May 2020 level, 0.8 days below the latest five-year average, but 2.4 days above the 2015-2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 remains unchanged from the previous report at 27.7 mb/d, around 5.0 mb/d higher than in 2020. Based on the initial forecasts for world oil demand and non-OPEC supply in 2022, demand for OPEC crude is forecast at 28.7 mb/d, some 1.1 mb/d higher than the 2021 level. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 Feature Article Feature Article The outlook for the oil market in 2022 Following a strong rebound in 2021, global economic Graph 1: GDP growth forecast, y-o-y changes, % growth in 2022 is forecast to grow by 4.1%, y-o-y 5.5 World 4.1 (Graph 1). 2021* This forecast assumes continued progress in the 4.9 2022* OECD containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Very high sovereign debt levels could thus become a considerable burden for the fiscal health of many economies. The positive developments in the containment of the pandemic as well as the solid expectations for global economic growth are assumed to spur consumption for oil in 2022, with world oil demand forecast to grow by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y, to average 99.9 mb/d. World oil demand in 2H22 is expected to exceed 100 mb/d. Within regions, OECD oil demand is forecast to rise Graph 2: World oil demand growth forecast, by 1.5 mb/d.

Both on-road diesel, including trucking, as well as increasing industrial, construction and agricultural activities in OECD America, Europe and China will support diesel demand. Light distillates will be supported by capacity additions – NGL plants in the US, Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) plants in China, and steady petrochemical margins. Jet fuel will continue to recover, as domestic and international air travel pick up, but business travel is expected to lag. Uncertainties remain, including COVID-19-related challenges and their impact on transportation fuels; the above-mentioned economic developments; extreme weather; technological advances, including digitalization; penetration of electric vehicles; and energy policy changes.

The increases were driven by a rally in the futures markets and a strengthening of the global physical crude market amid higher crude demand from refiners and the prospect of further improvements in oil demand in the transportation sector during the summer driving season. In June, North Sea Dated increased by $4.45 m-o-m, or 6.5%, to an average of $72.96/b. The NYMEX WTI and Dubai first-month prices rose respectively by $6.15 m-o-m and $5.09, or 9.4% and 7.7%, to settle at $71.38/b and $71.50/b. The ORB value also increased for the second consecutive month in June to its highest monthly average since October 2018, rising along with higher related crude benchmarks. The ORB value rose $4.98 m-o-m, or 7.4%, to settle at an average of $71.89/b. Crude oil futures prices extended their rally in June for the second consecutive month and reached their highest levels since October 2018 on a daily basis, as investors turned increasingly optimistic about the outlook for oil demand recovery and expectations of a stronger global oil market in 2H21. The market optimism was bolstered by accelerating vaccination rates in several countries, the easing of travel restrictions and data indicating a continued recovery in road transportation, specifically in the US and Europe. The large decline in US crude stocks in June added support to the market. The ICE Brent front month rose by $5.10 m-o-m, or 7.5%, in June to average $73.41/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $6.20 m-o-m, or 9.5%, to average $71.35/b. ICE Brent was $23.13 higher y-t-d, or 54.9%, at $65.23/b, while NYMEX WTI was $25.40 higher, or 69.0%, at $62.22/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in June by $5.30 m-o-m, or 8.0%, to settle at $71.75/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $22.01, or 52.6%, at $63.88/b. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted their net-long positions related to crude in June, particularly in NYMEX WTI, as speculators were betting on rising oil prices and anticipating a potentially stronger global oil market. Meanwhile, global oil supply growth, including in the US, was expected to be limited. The backwardation structure of all three major oil benchmarks strengthened and the front-months continued to increase their premium over the future months’ contracts on strengthening outlooks for the oil supply/demand fundamentals in coming months. This was driven by expectations of solid demand recovery during the summer holiday season and improving prompt crude demand from refiners. Global sweet/sour crude differentials were mixed over the month, widening further in the US and Europe as differentials for most regional sweet grades rose on healthy light distillate margins and higher demand from refiners. They narrowed in Asia on a stronger sour market. Crude spot prices Crude oil spot prices rose firmly in June, extending Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement the previous month’s gains. The increase was driven US$/b by a rally in futures markets as well as a strengthening 80 of the global physical crude market amid higher crude 70 demand from refiners and the prospect for further improvements in oil demand in the transportation 60 sector during the summer driving season. After 50 lagging behind the futures market for several months, the physical market showed signs of strength in June, 40 which was reflected in higher crude differentials and 30 the easing of the crude overhang in most major regions.

Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements Asian crude was driven by robust demand from Chinese and Indian refiners, which strongly supported the value of Dubai and pushed its forward curve into deeper backwardation. According to market sources, Indian refiners raised gradually their crude runs in June from the May slump, in response to higher demand as the government eased lockdown and mobility restrictions. Preliminary data from Indian state refiners showed gasoline and gasoil sales rose 29.4% and 18.5%, respectively. The improving COVID-19 situation in India encouraged local refiners to increase runs. In Europe, refiners showed higher buying interest, particularly for crude in the Atlantic Basin, as many refiners completed their spring maintenance. In the US, the weekly refiner net input of crude oil rose to 16.3 mb/d in the week to 11 June, its highest since January 2020. Meanwhile, crude supply growth remained restrained, and supply from stocks probably eased. OECD oil stocks fell for several consecutive months and stood below the 2015-2019 average level in May. In June, North Sea Dated and Dubai front-month prices rose to their highest monthly average since October 2018, while the WTI front-month price settled at the highest monthly average since November 2014. The large drop in US crude oil stocks for six consecutive weeks, including in the Cushing trading hub, also supported oil prices, an evident sign that the market is strengthening. In June, North Sea Dated increased by $4.45, or 6.5%, to an average of $72.96/b. The WTI and Dubai first month rose respectively by $6.15 and $5.09, or 9.4% and 7.7%, to settle at $71.38/b and $71.50/b. Crude differentials of light sweet crude mostly strengthened in June, specifically in the West African, Mediterranean and Caspian markets, buoyed by healthier refining margins, specifically for gasoline, and firm demand from refiners in Europe and the Asia Pacific. Most light sweet crude differentials were priced at premiums against the North Sea Dated benchmark in the second half of June. Crude differentials of Bonny Light, Forcados, and Qua Iboe rose in June their highest premium against the Brent benchmark since July 2020, increasing on a monthly average to premiums of 34¢/b, 59¢/b and 54¢/b, respectively.

The crude differential of medium-heavy sweet crude Cabinda also rose in June by 62¢, m-o-m, to a premium of 41¢/b. Nonetheless, North Sea crude differentials weakened slightly in the first half of June amid higher competition from similar crude from other regions in the Atlantic Basin, and a limited arbitrage opportunity to the Asian market, as the Brent-Dubai spread widened significantly. The forties and Ekofisk crude differentials fell by 61¢ and 32¢, respectively, on a monthly average in June to settle at a premium of 19¢/b and 58¢/b. In the US Gulf Coast (USGC), Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars crude differentials weakened in June, falling by 56¢ and 86¢, respectively, on a monthly average, to a premium of $1.51/b and a discount of 82¢/b. Nonetheless, in the Middle East, the value of Dubai-related crudes on the spot market remained supported by strong demand from Asia-Pacific refiners, specifically from China and India, as well as widening Brent-Dubai differentials that limited west-to-east arbitrage opportunities, thus supporting Dubai-related crude. The value of the Oman crude differential rose by 75¢ m-o-m in June to a premium of $1.97/b, while the Upper Zakum crude differential fell slightly to a discount of 21¢/b in June. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB value also increased in June for the second consecutive month to its highest monthly average since October 2018, rising along with higher related crude benchmarks. The ORB value rose $4.98 m-o-m, or 7.4%, to settle at an average of $71.89/b. Lower official selling prices for June loadings, particularly of medium and heavy sour components for Asia, limited the performance of the ORB value compared to other crude benchmarks. Compared to the previous year, the y-t-d ORB was up $24.64, or 62.9%, from $39.20/b in 2020, to an average of $63.85/b so far this year. All ORB component values rose in June, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend, and Zafiro – rising $4.71, or 7.1% m-o-m on average, to $71.50/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy, and Kuwait Export – increased by $4.96, or 7.4% m-o-m on average, to settle at $72.19/b. Murban crude rose by $5.52, or 8.3% m-o-m on average, to settle at $72.34/b. The Merey component also rose by $4.39 or 8.9% m-o-m on average, to settle at $53.52/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices extended their rally in June for the second consecutive month and reached their highest levels since October 2018 on daily basis, as investors turned increasingly optimistic about the outlook for oil demand recovery and expectations of a stronger global oil market in 2H21. On a monthly average, ICE Brent front-month rose 7.5% higher to settle at its highest since October 2018, while NYMEX WTI rose 9.5% to its highest since November 2014. The market optimism was bolstered by accelerating vaccination rates in several countries and the easing of travel restrictions. Moreover, data indicated a continued recovery in road transportation, specifically in the US and Europe, which coincides with the start of the holiday driving season. Furthermore, supportive economic data, including US employment; higher vaccination rates; and the continued easing of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions are supporting demand higher. Data showing a further global decline in new COVID-19 infections, including in India and other Asian countries, added confidence to the market, brightened the oil demand outlook and supported oil prices higher. The strengthening oil market was reflected in the continued drop in global oil stocks, specifically the sharp decline in US crude oil stocks in recent weeks. According to the EIA weekly report, US crude oil stocks fell for six consecutive weeks, declining by nearly 34 mb between the week to 14 May and the week to 25 June, amid limited growth of US oil supply and higher refinery intakes. The decision of OPEC and non-OPEC producers in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) on 1 June to maintain their production adjustments unchanged for July 2021 added support to the market.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements Nonetheless, the surge of daily infections of the COVID-19 Delta variant in several countries including in the UK, Russia, and some Asian and African countries raised concerns about a potential reinstatement of travel restrictions and slowing oil demand recovery, which weighed on market sentiment and limited oil price gains. The US dollar strengthened against other main currencies after the Federal Reserve signalled it might raise interest rates as soon as 2023, which also limited oil price gains. By late June, the US dollar index rose to its highest since mid-April against a basket of other currencies. The ICE Brent front month rose by $5.10 m-o-m, or 7.5%, in June to average $73.41/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $6.20 m-o-m, or 9.5%, to average $71.35/b. ICE Brent was $23.13 higher y-t-d, or 54.9%, at $65.23/b, while NYMEX WTI was $25.40 higher, or 69.0%, at $62.22/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in June by $5.30 m-o-m, or 8.0%, to settle at $71.75/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $22.01, or 52.6%, at $63.88/b. On 14 July, ICE Brent stood at $74.76/b and NYMEX WTI at $73.13/b. The ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI spread narrowed further in June as the NYMEX WTI benchmark continued to perform better than ICE Brent. On a monthly average, the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI spread narrowed by $1.10 m-o-m in June to stand at $2.06/b, its lowest level since October 2020. Traders were more optimistic about the NYMEX WTI benchmark on the prospect of strengthening supply/demand fundamentals in the US market and declining crude stocks, specifically in the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub, amid expectations of further US oil demand recovery. The EIA revised up its forecast for US gasoline demand for this year. Meanwhile, crude stocks at Cushing fell 5.4 mb between the week of 4 June and the week of 25 June, according to the EIA weekly data. The spread between the value of North Sea Dated and WTI Houston also narrowed in June by $1.59/b on a monthly average to stand at $1.02/b, compared to $2.61/b in January. Crude value in the USGC was supported by robust crude demand from domestic refiners, as refinery output continued to recover in PADD2 and PADD3. According to EIA data, the weekly US refiner net input of crude oil rose to 16.3 mb/d in the week to 11 June, its highest since January 2020, and the weekly US utilization of refinery operable capacity increase to 92.9%. Higher crude exports from the USGC in June that average about 3.5 mb added support to domestic crude values. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted their net-long positions related to crude in June, particularly in NYMEX WTI, as speculators were betting on rising oil prices and anticipating a potential stronger global oil market in 2H21 amid signs of a swift global economic and oil demand recovery. Meanwhile, global oil supply growth, including in the US, was expected to be limited. Nonetheless, speculators showed some caution in the second half of June by reducing slightly their net long positions, probably prompted by worries about the resurgence of the COVID-19 cases in several countries, including the UK and some Asian countries. By late June, combined futures and options net long positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI were 14.7%, or 91,650 contracts higher compared to the level in the week to 25 May at 624,307 contracts. Between the week ending 29 June and the week of 25 May, money managers were net buyers of about 92 mb in both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI.

Compared to the week to 25 May, combined futures and options net long positions in Brent increased by 49,949 contracts, or 19.3%, to reach 308,401 lots in the week to 29 June, according to the ICE Exchange. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements In the week ending 29 June, gross short positions rose by 6,806 lots, or 6.5%, to 111,081 contracts, while gross long positions rose by 56,755 lots, or 15.6%, to 419,482 contracts during the same period. Money managers also raised their positions related to WTI in June and at a higher rate, as speculators turned more optimistic about the economic and oil demand recovery in the US amid the speeding up of vaccinations and lifting of virus-related restrictions. Combined futures and options net long positions related to WTI increased by 41,701 contracts, or 11.4%, to 407,556 lots in the week to 29 June. This was due to a decline in short positions by 18,268 lots, or 41.2%, to 26,117 contracts, and long positions rose by 23,433 contracts, or 5.7%, to 433,673 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The futures market structure The backwardation structure of all three major oil benchmarks – ICE Brent, NYMEX WTI and DME Oman – strengthened in June and the front-months continue to increase their premium over the future-months contracts on the strengthening outlook for the oil supply/demand fundamentals in 2H21 amid expectations of solid demand recovery and a slow increase of global oil supply. Signs of solid oil demand recovery in the summer holiday season and improving prompt crude demand from European, Asian and US refiners also contributed to steepen futures forward curves.

The forward curve of Brent futures steepened in June compared to the previous month, evidence that the global market rebalancing is accelerating and reflecting the prospects of strengthening global oil market fundamentals in the coming months. Brent futures near-month prices were supported by declining global oil inventories, specifically in OECD countries, as well as an easing of the crude overhang in the Atlantic Basin as refiners raised runs, while some European refiners finished the spring maintenance season. The ICE Brent first-month premium to the third month rose by 62¢ m-o-m, to a backwardation of $1.29/b. The ICE Brent’s first to the sixth month also moved into deeper backwardation last month to settle at $3.02 on average compared to a backwardation of $1.98/b one month earlier. The US NYMEX WTI forward curve also steepened in June as the supply overhang in the US significantly eased along with a large drop in US crude oil stocks in May and June. Firm oil demand in the US as a result of the summer driving season, along with the easing of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and an accelerating vaccination trend in the country, boosted market optimism. Furthermore, the US refiners raised their throughputs in June to their highest since January 2020 in a sign they are anticipating higher oil demand in the coming months. Meanwhile, US crude supply growth is expected to remain limited. The NYMEX WTI first-to-third-month spread widened to a backwardation of $1.07/b on average in June compared to a backwardation of 36¢/b one month earlier. In Asia, strong crude demand from Chinese and Indian refiners and narrow arbitrage opportunities from the Atlantic Basin sharply supported the prompt Mideast crude value and largely contributed to strengthening DME Oman and Dubai price structures. Expectations of a stronger sour crude market in 2H21 also supported near-month prices. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1/M3 spread widened to a backwardation of $1.61/b in June, from a backwardation of $1.09/b in May, or an increase of 52¢/b. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Crude spreads Global sweet/sour crude differentials were mixed over the month, widening further in the US and Europe as differentials for most regional sweet grades rose on healthy light distillate margins and higher demand from refiners. They narrowed in Asia on a stronger sour market. The value of light sweet crude strengthened in Europe Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC in June as refiners in Europe and the US increased US$/b demand for sweeter grades amid strong demand for 8 light distillate products like gasoline. The easing 6 supply overhang of light sweet crude in the Atlantic 4 Basin also added support. Meanwhile, the value of sour crude Urals in Northwest Europe and the 2 Mediterranean markets remained under pressure in 0 June on soft demand for the grade from European -2 refiners and an unfavourable arbitrage to the Asian market, as the Brent-Dubai spread widened, making Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Brent-related crudes less competitive in the east-Suez market. On a monthly average, the North Sea DatedTapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals Urals spread in Northwest Europe rose to a premium LLS-Mars of $1.39/b in June, widening by 14¢, from a premium Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. of $1.25/b in May. Similarly, in the USGC the LLS-Mars spread widened 30¢ m-o-m, to an average of $2.33/b, in June as the LLS light sweet crude value rose more than Mars sour crude value. Strengthening light sweet crude margins in the USGC, driven by higher gasoline margins compared to sour crude, gave some support to the value of LLS crude. Higher demand for light sweet crude for exports from the USGC added support. However, in Asia the Tapis/Dubai spread narrowed in June by 55¢ to average $2.46/b compared to $3.01/b in May. Strong demand for medium and heavy sour crude from Asian refiners, specifically China and India, pushed Dubai-related crude higher. The latter rose more than Tapis light sweet crude despite a wider Brent-Dubai frontmonth exchange of futures for swaps (EFS Dubai), which reduced west-to-east arbitrage opportunities and supported light sweet crude in East Suez market. The Brent-Dubai front-month exchange of futures for swaps (EFS Dubai) widened further on a monthly average in June, by 59¢, to $3.63/b, compared to $3.04/b in May. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodities continued their ascending trend in June, with broad-based increases in crude oil, coal and natural gas. Coal prices jumped to their highest point in a decade amid strong demand for power generation in Asia and restricted supplies. Natural gas prices rose across regions, supported by localized heat waves, lower than average inventory levels and rising demand based on the reopening of economies. Crude oil prices rose on the expectation of a solid demand recovery. Base metals declined as the pace of expansion in global manufacturing eased during the month and some recovery was seen in the value of the US dollar. Gold prices declined on expectations of faster-thananticipated interest rate increases in the US. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index rose m-o-m by 9.4% in June, with crude oil, natural gas and coal rising across all regions. The average index level was up by 63% in the period January–June 2021 compared with the same five months in 2020. As mentioned in the previous MOMR, the very low prices experienced in 2Q20 contributed to strong y-o-y comparisons. The non-energy index declined by 1.4% m-o-m, with the base metals index showing its first decline since April 2020, while agricultural commodities also declined. The non-energy index was up by 36.5% in the January–June period, compared with the same period in 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In June, the Henry Hub natural gas price rose by around 12% m-o-m to $3,2/mmbtu. Prices strengthened as warmer-than-average weather and strong LNG exports – in view of a favourable price differential – limited storage gains. Some localized disruptions also contributed to limiting storage builds. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 76 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 25 June 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 2,558 bcf, around 5.3% below the latest five-year average. At the end of May, stocks were 2.6% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe rose strongly in June, with the average Title Transfer Facility price up by around 16% m-o-m to $10.3/mmbtu. Average prices in the January–June period are 2.1 times higher than the same period last year. Price were supported by low inventory levels and a further increase in carbon emission prices, which reached around $66/mt, favouring natural gas usage versus coal. EU inventories ended June around 47.5% full, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Inventories were approximately 80% full at the end of June last year. Australian thermal coal prices rose m-o-m by 21.4% in June to $130.0/mt, the highest point in a decade. In the January–June period, prices were around 62% higher than the same period last year. They strengthened due to warmer-than-average weather in Northeast Asia, especially China, and strong industrial activity, resulting in higher thermal power demand – up by 5.6% y-o-y back in May. At the same time, growth in coal output in China has been limited in comparison – up by 0.6% y-o-y in May, while some restricted output across major exporters during the last few months due to extreme weather also contributed to tightening the market. According to the latest Chinese trade data, coal imports rose by 35% m-o-m in June to their highest level this year at 28.4 million tonnes.

The base metal price index declined m-o-m by 2.4% in June as the pace of expansion of global manufacturing cooled slightly and the value of the US dollar recovered during the month. Average monthly copper prices declined m-o-m in June by 5.2% to average $9,631.5/mt. Average prices in the January–June period were 65.5% higher than in the same period of 2020. Manufacturing activity expansion remained robust during the month, but the pace decelerated in some major economies, including China, the US and Japan. On the physical side, stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose by 72% to 211,525 tonnes at the end of June from 122,425 tonnes at the end of May, suggesting a less tight market. Moreover, estimations from the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) show a surplus of 150,000 tonnes in the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the first three months of 2021. Iron ore prices further rose m-o-m in June by 3.2% to a monthly average of $214.4/mt – a record high. Average prices in the January–June period were twice those observed over the same period last year. Steel-making activity rose globally by 16.5% in May compared with the same month last year, and by 14.5% in the January– May period compared with the same period last year. Iron ore imports in China declined slightly in June by 0.4% m-o-m, but were up by 2.6% in the January–June period compared with the same period last year. In the group of precious metals, gold prices declined on average by 0.8% m-o-m in June, amid some increase in real interest rates in the US in the first half of the month, which subsequently faded away in the second half of the month, resulting in some recovery in prices. Meanwhile, silver and platinum prices declined by 1.9% and 7.4%, respectively. Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ net length positions increased in natural gas, crude oil and gold during the month, but decreased in copper. Despite that, investors continue to hold an optimistic view of commodities markets.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 9 World Economy World Economy The global economic recovery has continued, with generally strong improvements in key economies. While some challenges were already apparent in 2Q21, there are still some uncertainties about the path and the depth of 2H21 momentum, with the potential emergence of new COVID-19 variants and/or mutations posing a particular risk. Moreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates could cause severe fiscal strain. While key interest rates are still low and are assumed to stay at a very accommodative level in the near term, inflation scares have come to the forefront very recently, fuelling the debate about whether the low interest rate environment will have to end soon. It is still too early to conclusively define whether rising inflation, with a special focus on US developments, is indeed temporary. Certainly, the subject warrants close monitoring. In the meantime, the underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 are unchanged. This includes the assumption that COVID-19 will be largely contained in 2H21 in the sense that a large majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated sufficiently and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for major emerging economies. In addition, 2H21 pent-up demand is forecast to accelerate, especially in the contact-intensive sectors. The positive dynamic in the US seems to have gained further pace in 2Q21, while the Euro-zone and Japan remained impacted by COVID-19-related social distancing measures to some extent. With the exception of China, the pandemic has continued to impact growth in emerging and developing economies. With these counterbalancing forces, the 2021 global economic growth forecast remains unchanged at 5.5%. Some of the 2H21 growth dynamic is forecast to carry over into 2022. However, with less need for fiscal stimulus and a lessening dynamic in monetary stimulus, growth rates are anticipated to normalise to some extent, but remain supported by a variety of government-led stimulus efforts. While depending primarily on COVID-19 related developments, global economic growth is forecast at 4.1% in 2022.

Global Update on latest developments The combination of a generally improving global situation in containing COVID-19, especially in the wealthier economies and China, has led to a continuing recovery in global economic growth. While the US and China were already posting strong growth numbers in 1Q21, the reopening in the UK and the Euro-zone led to a further growth dynamic towards the end of 2Q21. However, ongoing COVID-19-related challenges in economies with high vaccination rates, like the UK and Chile, have again highlighted the potential difficulties that may continue in reining in the pandemic. Also, inflationary concerns, especially in the US, in combination with rising interest rates, have come to the forefront in past months. When disaggregating the reasons for the recent jump in inflation, it is obvious that the base effect from last year’s pandemic pushes up inflation on a yearly comparison, which is the most-watched measure. Moreover, reopening effects and supply chain disruptions that may turn out to be temporary have pushed up inflation on a short-term basis. Particularly, US inflation, which is very important, was very much driven by automotive-related price rises, which were affected by a combination of two events — reopening and supply chain disruptions. A strong pick-up in US travel and transportation led to quickly rising demand for cars, light vehicles, trucks and related services, while at the same time a semiconductor shortage led to supply-related price rise. Moreover, a strong annual rise in energy and food prices drove inflation. Considering that US crude oil benchmarks turned negative in April 2020, price rises are forecast to moderate in the short term. In the meantime, that so-called reflation trade, resulting in rising US treasury yields, has abated somewhat as it seems that some of the inflationary effects could be transitory. 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Economy In general, the recovery of the global economy has continued, though at a diverging pace. After the US and to some extent China led to a global recovery in 1H21, the Euro-zone and Japan, along with India and to some extent Russia and Brazil, continued to remain negatively impacted by extended COVID-19-related social distancing measures in 1H21. Although, the easing of restrictions, especially in the EU and in Japan, towards the end of 2Q21 led to a strengthening global recovery. Moreover, Russia and Brazil have already started to benefit from the recovery in global trade and the rise in commodities demand, as well as an improving price environment. With the further easing of lockdown measures across the world, a gradual shift from manufacturing and non-contact intensive services to contact-intensive service is materialising. This applies primarily to the sectors of travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure. This has been an important support factor for the pick-up of activity in the Euro-zone, with many countries deeply invested in the tourism sector. Additionally, selective Asian economies benefitted from re-emerging activity in travel and tourism, further supported by the rebound in China. As a very important driver, global trade continued its Graph 3 1: Global trade considerable rebound thanks to the base effects from % change y-o-y large declines in last year, but also due to ongoing 30 dynamic in global economic activity.

Near-term expectations Momentum is forecast to accelerate in 2H21, and while the OECD economies and China took the lead in growth appreciation in 1H21, momentum will be accompanied by the so-far less successful emerging and developing economies. Moreover, it is assumed that the contact-intensive sector will contribute strongly to further economic improvements. The underlying assumption for short-term growth is that in 2H21 COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and the pandemic will also not pose a major obstacle for large emerging economies. However, much lower vaccination rates in emerging and developing economies may also lead to a challenging situation going forward and the latest rise in infections in selective economies of the Euro-zone, Chile and others have shown that the recovery path will be tested by ongoing pandemic-related developments. Another important key assumption is that inflation in the OECD economies will remain anchored in the sense that in 2021 it will not significantly exceed the 2% OECD average on an annual basis and will stand at around 4% in the US. For 2022, these levels are forecast to stand at slightly below 2% for OECD economies on average and at around 2.5% for the US. These levels would imply no unexpected interest rate hikes by G4 central banks before 2023. The 2021 forecast has only seen selective adjustments in the OECD, including an upward GDP growth revision for the UK from 5% to 5.8% after the rebound in 2Q21 produced strengthening momentum. This, among other smaller revisions, lifted the 2021 OECD growth forecast to 4.9%, compared with 4.8% the previous month. In the emerging and developing economies, growth forecasts are also almost unchanged. Only Brazil was revised up to 3.2% from 3%, amid better progress in 1H21 growth. With these base assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is forecast to stand at 0.4% q-o-q and accelerate to 1.4% q-o-q in 2Q21. A major acceleration is then forecast to materialize in 2H21, with the 3Q21 growth forecast at 2.6% q-o-q and 4Q21 growth at 1.9% q-o-q. The growth pattern in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally spread and in line with average historical patterns.

Among the most pressing issues are the possibility of emerging new COVID-19 variants and the consequent efficacy of vaccines. Additionally, inflationary developments will need to be followed, as the danger of rising interest rates, especially in the US, and consequent repercussions for the global economy could potentially derail the ongoing strong recovery. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments US growth has seen a strong rebound in 1H21, supported by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus in a combination with a relatively successful vaccination campaign. 1Q21 GDP growth was confirmed at 6.4% qo-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) and most output indicators have confirmed an acceleration for 2Q21. The labour market has recovered and consequently consumer and business confidence has seen sharp reversals from last year’s depressed levels. Pent-up demand is considered to be another important factor in the recovery. The net personal savings rate as a percentage of net disposable personal income is pointing to continued spending ability, standing at 12.4% in May, compared with 14.9% in April and a decline from 27.6% in March, but compared with an average of around 7% pre-COVID-19. Continuing consumer spending is also supported by a rise in consumer confidence, which maintained a supportive level in June when it rose to 127.3, compared with 120 in May, based on the index provided by the Conference Board. The government announced that it found broad bipartisan agreement for a $1.2 trillion infrastructure stimulus package planned for over eight years. Moreover, the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) also continued with its strong support, pointing to a continuation in its accommodative monetary policy. However, recently the topic of overheating and inflation in the US economy was widely discussed, as the possibility of rising interest rates to avoid overheating the economy could dampen ongoing growth. US CPI inflation stood at 5.3% y-o-y in June. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Economy The strongest appreciation came from the sub-sector of transportation, which rose by 21.3% y-o-y, indicating an ongoing price-lifting effect after the reopening of the economy and supply restrictions due to the semiconductor sector. Moreover, among other COVID-19-related inflation effects, the 2020 base was greatly distorted by the effects of pandemic-induced lockdowns. Last year’s April and May inflation index levels declined due to the pandemic. With the two excluded volatile components of energy and food, inflation would have stood at 4.5% y-o-y in June, compared with 3.8% y-o-y in May. Reopening effects and temporary supply shortages seem to continue driving current inflation levels, and it remains to be seen if this is a continuing trend. In this regard, it also remains to be seen how the ongoing US labour supply shortage will develop. The extension of unemployment payments and childcare necessities during the still-ongoing pandemic and the fear of retuning back to the office amid infection risks has led the US participation rate to decline from more than 63% pre-pandemic to only 61.6% in June. If the trend continues, wages and earnings could see a sustained lift, with a real scare to rising and unhealthy inflation. Positively, it could also be argued that there is still significant slack in the US labour market and thus inflation pressures may ease in the near term. The labour market gained partial strength again in Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market June. The unemployment rate rose slightly to stand % % at 5.9% compared with 5.8% in May. 62 12 Non-farm payroll additions increased by 850,000 in 10 61.6 June, compared with an upward revision of 583,000 in May and 269,000 for April. However, employers 61 8 seem to have ongoing issues regarding recruiting, 6 especially in the labour-intensive services sector, 5.9 which is also reflected in the latest PMI readings. 60 4 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Particpation rate (LHS) Unemploment rate (RHS) Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations After 1Q21 GDP growth of 6.4% q-o-q SAAR, 2Q21 growth is forecast to accelerate to 9.0% q-o-q SAAR. Growth in 3Q21 is forecast to reach 6.8% q-o-q SAAR and then slow to 2.8% q-o-q SAAR in 4Q21. With this slowdown towards the end of the year, current inflationary pressures should taper off to some extent. Growth in 2H21 is forecast to remain supported by ongoing consumer spending and investment. A significant lift in growth will come from the contact-intensive service sectors, which have already seen a strong rebound in 2Q21. Growth in 2021 remains significantly supported by fiscal and monetary stimulus. Findings from the Secretariat show that the 1.9 trillion USD fiscal stimulus plan, the American Rescue Plan, supports GDP growth up to around 7.5 pp for 2021. The effectiveness of these and other stimulus measures will determine how much US GDP growth will be supported in the end. With additional fiscal measures that may be implemented by the US administration over the year, US GDP growth could reach 7% or higher in 2021. The latest plan to invest $1.2 trillion in US infrastructure over eight years, including an additional $600 billion, is expected to be put into law towards the end of the year. The plan is forecast to support growth in 2022 and onwards. Assuming an eight-year period on this investment plan as indicated and an acceleration in spending towards the middle of the time-span, and by applying a multiplier of around 0.7 as a reasonable degree, a positive GDP growth impact, in addition to the US baseline forecast, would amount to 0.2 percentage points in 2022.

The economy remains well supported by fiscal and monetary stimulus in in the next year and in addition ongoing rebounding momentum is forecast to lift growth to a level of 3.6%. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, remain. An important concern is that inflation will rise at such a pace that market rates will carry an unexpected dynamic, impairing the ongoing recovery. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Euro-zone’s growth dynamic benefitted significantly from the reopening of large parts of the economic region towards the end of 2Q21. The important contact-intensive services sector, in particular, has seen strong support, a momentum that is forecast to carry over into 2H21. However, the latest COVID-19 infection numbers in some key economies, including Spain and the Netherlands, highlight the fragility of the Euro-zone’s recovery, which is indeed very much impacted by the travel and tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors. In the meantime, vaccination rates have risen and the ratio of those who have at least received one dose is now well above 50%. 1Q21 GDP growth was reported at -1% q-o-q seasonally adjusted (SA), translating into a 1Q21 yearly decline of -1.6%. This is a slightly larger decline than previously estimated by the statistical office. As social distancing measures were kept relatively stringent in 2Q21, GDP is anticipated to show only moderate growth. The European Central Bank (ECB), has continued its accommodative monetary policies. In addition, it has finalised its strategic review and indicated as an outcome of this exercise that it will likely tolerate slightly higher inflation, at least temporarily. The latest inflation level in the Euro-zone was recorded at 2% in June, following a level of 1.9% y-o-y in May. This is not at a worrying level so far. Even more so, when excluding the volatile items of food and energy, inflation stood at only 1% y-o-y in June and 0.8% y-o-y in May. So, while the ECB seems to have more flexibility in providing monetary support, it seems that monetary stimulus measures are becoming less effective. Lending to the private sector by monetary financial institutions stood at 2.2% y-o-y in May, after reaching 2.6% y-o-y in April and 3.2% y-o-y in March. Also, at least a third of lending activity ends up in the real estate sector, while lending to non-financial co-operations rose by only 0.6% y-o-y in May and 1.8% y-o-y in April. 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Economy The labour market has continued improving, a trend Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales supported by the latest available April numbers from % change y-o-y Eurostat — the unemployment rate stood at 7.9% 30 y-o-y in May after reaching 8.1% in April and March.

April after reaching 11.2% y-o-y in March. Near-term expectations While the assumption of COVID-19 containment in 2H21 and beyond is unchanged, the most recent rise in infections in some parts of the Euro-zone have highlighted the challenges connected to the pandemic. It remains to be seen whether vaccination rates will achieve sufficient levels towards the autumn and winter seasons in order to prevent further spreading of the new variants, which are apparently more contagious. However, it is sensible not to be carried away by overly optimistic assumptions, especially when considering that the recovery of the Euro-zone’s contact-intensive sectors will be key to the overall recovery. So far, the momentum of the Euro-zone economy has gained pace towards the end of 2Q21 and is forecast to accelerate further into 3Q21. Government-led stimulus also provides a sound financial base for 2H21 and consequently 2022 recovery. In addition, global trading – and especially momentum in the Euro-zone’s major trading partners, the US and China – are forecast to accelerate in pace. 1Q21 GDP growth was reported at -2.5% q-o-q SAAR, affected by lockdowns and other COVID-19-related social-distancing measures. By 2Q21, growth is forecast to accelerate to 4.5% q-o-q SAAR. The main pick-up on a quarterly basis is forecast to materialize in 3Q21 when domestic consumption, investments and a rise in exports are all forecast to lift GDP growth to 10.8% q-o-q SAAR. 4Q21 is still expected to be strong and reach 5.7% q-o-q SAAR. The June PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed to Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs an ongoing improving situation in the manufacturing Index and services sectors. Momentum in the services 70 sector is forecast to gain significant pace in the 63.4 coming months. The manufacturing PMI rose to 63.4, 60 58.3 after reaching 63.1 in May.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 15 World Economy OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Japan’s economy is gradually recovering, although the rebound remains held back by pandemic-related social distancing measures. Industrial production has performed well as this has been very much supported by external trade. So, while indicators point to an ongoing improving economy, the pandemic is preventing full growth potential from unfolding, as domestic activity will continue to be held back by renewed emergency measures in Tokyo from 12 July to 22 August. Numerous other prefectures are impacted as well by at least semi-emergency measures. This will especially effect the period of the Tokyo Olympics. The games will need to follow strict regulations and no spectators are allowed. Therefore, consumption is forecast to remain relatively depressed. To counterbalance these measures, a supplementary budget containing fiscal stimulus measures is expected. Just before the latest implementation of emergency measures, consumer sentiment surveys were pointing to a solid recovery in domestic consumption. As this is now moved back towards August, the rebound will be slightly delayed. Growth in 1Q21 was reported at a slightly less impactful decline of 3.4% q-o-q SAAR. This is compared with -5.1% q-o-q SAAR in the previous estimate of Japan’s statistical office. 2Q21 growth seems to be very limited, as growth during this period was impacted by extended lockdown measures. In the meantime, consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved, mainly reflecting the easing of lockdown measures in June, though they are expected to retract again in July. Growth in industrial production (IP) was significantly positive in May on a yearly basis, also distorted by the sharp decline last year. May’s growth stood at 20.7% y-o-y, after seeing a rise of 14.6% y-o-y in April. However, on a monthly basis the decline in IP was significant, falling by 5.3% m-o-m on a seasonally adjusted basis, pointing at ongoing fragility in Japan’s economic recovery. Growth in exports recovered strongly as well, rising Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports by 49.6% y-o-y in May, after reaching 38% y-o-y in % change y-o-y April on a non-seasonally adjusted basis.

Near-term expectations After seeing a decline in 1Q21, Japan’s economy is forecast to recover somewhat and show slightly positive GDP growth in 2Q21, mainly driven and supported by external trade, as domestic developments have been muted due to the pandemic. Starting in August and after the lifting of current emergency measures, the rebound in domestic consumption is forecast to be strong and impactful. Hence, after the 1Q21 GDP decline of 3.9% q-o-q SAAR, it is assumed that the virus will be widely contained in Japan towards the end of 2Q21 and a strong rebound is expected to materialise in 2H21. Given the ongoing lockdown measures in 2Q21, growth is forecast at only 0.4% q-o-q SAAR in this period. This is lower than last month’s expectation, when the quarterly growth forecast stood at 0.8% q-o-q SAAR. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 should then pick up, with the global economy’s recovery gaining pace and domestic demand in Japan expected to rise further. Hence, growth is forecast at 7% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21 before slowing somewhat to reach 5% in 4Q21. However, pandemic-related uncertainties remain large. 16 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Economy The impact of the ongoing lockdown is also reflected Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs in the latest PMIs from June, with manufacturing Index decelerating, while the services sector index 60 improved, though clearly remaining below the growth52.4 55 indicating level of 50.

On the policy front, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) cut the amount of cash most banks must hold in reserve in order to boost lending, as economic growth began to falter.

Latin America Brazil Update on latest developments Recent economic indicators suggest a continuation of the pickup in economic activity supported by the increase in vaccination rates, which noticeably tempered the latest wave of COVID-19 fatalities. Industrial production returned to growth territory and rose by 1.4% in May in seasonally adjusted, m-o-m terms, according to the National Statistics Institute (IBGE). The recent growth marked the end of a three-month contraction in manufacturing output. The consumer confidence index jumped to 80.3% in June from 76.5% in May. Similarly, retail sales rose 16% y-o-y in May 2021 following a gain of 23.7% y-o-y in April. Pressures on the labour market have eased slightly.

Earlier, the government approved a new round of support known as the “corona voucher” and this should contribute to the economic recovery. However, fiscal policy is anticipated to be highly contractionary in the shortand medium-terms to offset the 2020 massive spending. Near-term expectations Brazil's real GDP in 1H21 appeared to be back to pre-pandemic levels and the economy was more resilient than expected despite the recent rise in COVID-19 infections. The recent hike in PMI indices mirrored the ongoing Graph 3 17: Brazil’s PMIs expansion in activity.

Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments South Africa’s real GDP contracted 3.20% y-o-y in 1Q21. Moreover, following the drastic increase of COVID-19 cases, South Africa in June 2021 applied an adjusted Level 4 lockdown with new containment measures for 14 days, commencing on 28 June. These new restrictions could weigh on the country’s economic recovery. On a positive note, the vaccine rollout is gaining momentum and key economic reforms are rapidly proceeding after making sluggish progress. Stress in the labour market continued. Indeed, in 1Q21 unemployment rose to 32.6%, the highest rate since comparable data started to be released in 2008. Total employment fell mostly in construction, private households and transportation services. The expanded definition of unemployment rose to 43.2% in 1Q21, up from 42.6% in 4Q20. Moreover, the unemployment rate among job-seekers between 15 and 24 years old hit a record high of 63.3%. Upward pressure on overall consumer price levels continued to build in South Africa. The inflation rate rose to 5.2% y-o-y in May 2021 from 4.4% y-o-y in April, above the 4.5% midpoint of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range of 3-6%. Part of the higher price pressure is due to last year's low base. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose 0.1%, easing from a 0.7% increase in the previous month. Similarly, producer prices surged 7.4% y-o-y in May 2021, following an increase of 6.7% y-o-y in April. It was also the highest producer inflation rate since July 2016. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 21 World Economy Near-term expectations Despite the surge in new COVID-19 cases and the political tension following the recent riots, the impact of the new restrictions might be less severe on 2021 GDP growth as the mobility rate and economic activities were advancing at higher-than-anticipated rates prior to the recent decline in the COVID-19 situation. Moreover, vaccine coverage is gaining momentum. In 2Q21, the RMB/BER business confidence index increased well above pre-pandemic levels to 50 from 35 in 1Q21 as confidence rebounded sharply in the manufacturing, retail trade and moto industry. By contrast, the fresh concerns over rising COVID-19 cases and tighter restrictions have pushed the Absa manufacturing PMI down to 57.4 in June from 57.8 in May 2021.

Russia and Central Asia Russia Update on the latest developments The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) revised Russia’s real GDP growth estimation for 1Q21 to -0.7% y-o-y from -1.0% y-o-y announced previously. The revision was supported by the slight improvements in industrial output and wholesale trade turnover. In May 2021, industrial production rose 11.8% y-o-y following a revised 7.6% y-o-y expansion in the previous month. The most recent industrial output growth was the biggest since December 2003. However, it was partially impacted by the low comparison base of 2020 when the country was under COVID-19 lockdown, and indeed, on a monthly basis (SA), industrial production grew only 1.1% in May 2021 following growth of 0.1% in April. On the demand side, despite the low 2020 base of comparison, major demand indicators point to a sharp recovery in private consumption. Retail sales registered a sharp expansion for the second consecutive month as retail trade increased by 27.2% y-o-y in May 2021, following a revised 35.1% in April 2021. On a monthly basis, retail sales increased by 1.1%, after a 0.3% rise in April. Inflationary pressures continued to weigh on the Graph 3 18: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate recovery.

Additionally, the rebound in global demand might add another growth potential for the Russian economy. OPEC Member Countries Saudi Arabia Non-oil economic activity continued to improve amid the expansion in non-oil exports, which advanced 46% y-o-y in April 2021. Indeed, non-oil sector activity was up 3.3% y-o-y amid the sector’s noticeable recovery from the pandemic. June’s PMI reading reflects this improvement and stood unchanged from May, at 56.4, which was the highest since January 2021, amid the strong recommencement of economic activity following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The government’s comprehensive programme to develop the water sector might push the recovery further as it creates a host of investment opportunities to the domestic and foreign investors throughout asset sales and public-private partnerships (PPPs). In May 2021, the consumer price index (CPI) edged up to 5.7% y-o-y, the highest so far in 2021, from 5.3% in April, amid the upward pressure of increasing food and beverages prices. Nevertheless, the improvement in oil prices and the recent pickup in global economic activity support a further recovery in 2021 that also would continue into 2022, though at a slower pace. Nigeria Nigeria's real GDP grew by 0.5% y-o-y in 1Q21, driven by growth of 2.3% in the agriculture sector. Industrial activities registered growth of 0.9% y-o-y following a contraction of 5.6% y-o-y on average in 2020. Services sector activities stayed in contraction territory, although at a softer rate as the sector contracted by only 0.4% y-o-y in 1Q21. The inflation edged down to 17.9% y-o-y in May 2021 from 18.1% y-o-y in April and 18.2% y-o-y in March amid slower price increases for domestically produced food goods and services. On the policy front, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently decided to keep its policy rate at 11.5%, noting the marginal decline in overall price levels that started in April 2021 and driven by the stabilized growth in food prices. Nevertheless the structurally high inflation represents a serious impediment for the ongoing economic recovery as well as exchange rate stability. According to the Debt Management Office, by the end of March 2021, Nigeria’s public debt went up to about US$87.2 billion, a 15.6% y-o-y increase; domestic debt rose 10.7% y-o-y; and external debt jumped 18.8% with obligations of US$32.9 bn. By international standards the 22% Debt-to-GDP ratio is moderate; however, the debt servicing costs are astronomical. In the near-term the high inflation and unemployment rate probably would weigh on the economic recovery OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 23 World Economy The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Growth of non-oil economic activity has moderated recently amid the spread of the new COVID-19 variant. In June 2021, the IHS Markit UAE PMI dropped to 52.2 from 52.3 a month earlier. However, the non-oil economy is anticipated to recover faster and stronger during the rest of the year, supported by a competitive tourism and travel sector; large-scale projects; new visa rules; the opening of the delayed Expo 2020; and expansionary government policy.

Total oil demand is projected to average 96.6 mb/d. 1Q21 was revised down amid slower-than-anticipated demand in the main OECD consuming countries. This was counterbalanced by better-than-expected data from OECD Americas in 2Q21, which is now projected to continue through 3Q21. In the OECD region, oil demand is anticipated to rise by 2.7 mb/d to reach 44.7 mb/d of total demand. This is nearly 3.0 mb/d lower than total demand in 2019, mainly due to a limited recovery in transportation fuel, especially jet fuel. OECD Americas demand is anticipated to rise the most in 2021, led by the US on the back of recovering gasoline and diesel demand. Light distillates are also projected to support demand growth this year. In the non-OECD region, oil demand is anticipated to rise by 3.3 mb/d to reach 51.9 mb/d of total demand in 2021. That is nearly 0.4 mb/d lower than 2019 total demand, despite expectations of fully recovering demand in China and India. A steady increase in industrial and transportation fuel demand supported by recovering economic activity is projected to boost demand in 2021. In 2022, healthy expectations for global economic growth in addition to improved containment of COVID19 through the acceleration of vaccination programmes, effective treatment and natural immunization, particularly in emerging and developing countries, along with frequent testing procedures, are assumed to spur consumption of oil next year to comparable pre-pandemic levels. World oil demand is anticipated to rise by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y, while total world oil demand is projected to reach 99.9 mb/d with 2H22 exceeding 100 mb/d. In the OECD, oil demand is anticipated to rise by 1.5 mb/d, as OECD Americas is expected to climb firmly, with US oil demand marginally below 2019 levels mainly due to lagging transportation fuel demand. OECD Europe and Asia Pacific will grow but remain lingering below 2019 consumption levels. In the non-OECD, oil demand is projected to show an increase of 1.8 mb/d with demand growth rising the most in China and India to exceed pre-pandemic levels, supported by a respectable recovery in transportation fuels and firm industrial fuel demand, including petrochemical feedstock. Other regions such as Other Asia, Latin America and the Middle East are also expected to see decent gains, supported by a positive economic outlook. In terms of fuels, gasoline and diesel are assumed to lead oil demand growth next year. A gradual return to pre-COVID-19 normality is expected to continue into 2022, which in turn will further support mobility in major consuming countries such as the US, China and India. Diesel gains will stem from both on-road diesel, including trucking, as well as increasing momentum in industrial, construction and agricultural activities in OECD America, Europe and China. Light distillates will be supported by new capacity additions; NGL plants in the US, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plants in China and steady petrochemical margins are assumed to additionally encourage demand for light-end products. Jet fuel will continue its recovery as domestic and international air travel pickup their pace, but slower demand for business travel will pressure this product category, forcing it to return to 2019 levels. The forecast remains subject to uncertainties, most profoundly COVID-19-related challenges and their impact on transportation fuels, trade tension issues, developments on the economic front, unusual weather conditions, the impact of technological advancements including digitalization, penetration of electric vehicles and energy policy changes are principal factors that may influence the short-term forecast for oil demand.

The latest available US monthly demand data for April imply sharply increasing US oil demand by approximately 4.8 mb/d y-o-y, making up 85% of losses incurred during the historical drop of April 2020. Demand was lower than in April 2019 by almost 0.9 mb/d. Gasoline and jet kerosene requirements increased the most, with gasoline gaining 2.9 mb/d y-o-y, while jet/kerosene increased by 0.6 mb/d y-o-y in April 2021. Both fuels fell sharply during the April 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, by 3.6 mb/d and 1.1 mb/d y-o-y, respectively. According to the Federal Highway Administration, vehicle miles of travel in the US shot up by 54.6% y-o-y in April this year after rising by 18.8% y-o-y in March. In April 2020, the indicator plunged by more than 40% y-o-y, to the lowest y-o-ydecline ever recorded. Additionally, light vehicle retail sales, as reported by Autodata and Haver Analytics, were at 18.7 million units according to seasonally adjusted annual rates (SAAR), compared with 18.1 million units in March. A quick recap of historical figures for the same index show total sales of 8.7 million units in April 2020 and 16.6 million units in April 2019. Industrial production, a gauge for industrial fuel demand, was also higher by 17.6% y-o-y in April after increasing by 1.5% y-o-y in March. The index dropped similarly in April 2019 by approximately 17.7% y-o-y, according to Federal Reserve Board data. Diesel demand was higher by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in April 2021 following an increase of 0.1 mb/d in March. Diesel consumption was at par with April 2019 levels. Preliminary data for May based on weekly input indicate the continuation of a recovery in transportation fuel performance, with both gasoline and jet kerosene increasing by more than 2.7 mb/d y-o-y collectively. Diesel is foreseen to increase by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in May 2021.

Near-term expectations Going forward, the vaccination rollout has provided optimism regarding management of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with massive stimulus programmes, high household savings and improving unemployment OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 27 World Oil Demand rates. This supports a positive outlook for oil demand prospects until the end of the year. The outlook remains pressured by COVID-19 developments, including the emergence of new variants and possible government countermeasures. A rebound in transportation fuels, including gasoline, is associated with labour market developments and gasoline retail prices, which currently are assumed to be limited due to high household savings. Risks stemming from the structural impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour, especially in the aviation sector, as well as the speed of vaccination programmes, are to be monitored closely going forward. Nevertheless, the aviation sector is projected to remain below 2019 levels. In 2022, OECD Americas oil demand is projected to increase by around 1.0 mb/d y-o-y with the US leading the region, up by more than 0.8 mb/d y-o-y. Demand growth will be driven by healthy economic growth, supported by large stimulus packages. Additionally, a strong increase in household savings during the pandemic and improved unemployment data will lend support to oil demand next year. Gasoline is projected to continue recovering in 2022, supported by improved unemployment rates, higher miles driven y-o-y, and steady y-o-y increases in vehicle sales. However, gasoline demand is anticipated to lag in 2019, pressured by a number of factors such as penetration of alternative fuels vehicles, improved efficiency in combustion engines and the increased use of technology impacting mobility. Expansion in the petrochemical industry, coupled with healthy petrochemical margins, will provide additional support to light distillates in 2022. On the other hand, reduced business travel post-2021, a continuation in fuel substitution programmes, and fuel efficiency gains, particularly in the road transportation sector, are all factored into OECD America’s 2022 oil demand outlook. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments European oil demand recorded the first monthly Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y increase in April, for the first time since April change 2019 and the third time since August 2018.

Transportation fuel demand was steeply lower than in April 2019, as diesel and gasoline were 0.5 mb/d and 0.3 mb/d lower than April 2019 levels. One of the indicators of European oil demand, new passenger car registrations, increased in April by 222% y-o-y, after increasing by 91.7% in March. It’s worth highlighting that the indicator recorded a decline of 78.8% y-o-y in April 2020 and 65.9% y-o-y in March 2020. Near-term expectations Going forward, the general expectations for the region’s oil demand in May, June and 2H21 remain positive with some predominant downside risks, as a result of uncertainties in relation to unforeseen strong COVID-19 waves that could strain the medical system or/and possible disruption of vaccination programmes. On the one hand, projected improvements in the economy, particularly in the travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors, government-led stimulus programmes, improved mobility – both road and air – and last year’s low baseline call for a steady recovery in oil requirements throughout 2H21. In 2022, OECD Europe oil demand is anticipated to rise by around 0.4 mb/d. Estimated developments in the economy, along with better containment of COVID-19, are the main assumptions for OECD Europe oil demand growth in 2022. In terms of products, middle distillates – including automotive diesel, followed by gasoline – are anticipated to lead product consumption in 2022, supported by improvements in mobility amid better COVID-19 containment measures, along with positive developments in the industrial and construction sectors. Conversely, downward risks that might affect the 2022 oil demand outlook are mostly related to economic uncertainty, including high debt levels and budgetary constraints, in addition to fuel substitution and efficiencies in the road transportation sector. OECD Europe oil demand will continue to linger below 2019 levels, mainly due to a slower pace of recovery in the transportation sector leading to slowly growing jet fuel and on-road diesel requirements compared with pre-pandemic levels. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments OECD Asia Pacific oil demand increased by 0.4 mb/d Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y in April, following an increase of more than change 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in March.

Sources: JODI, METI and OPEC. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 29 World Oil Demand The most recent available preliminary oil demand data for May from the Japanese Ministry of Economy Trade, and Industry (METI), show rising demand by almost 0.2 mb/d y-o-y compared with an increase of 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in April. Demand was lower than in May 2019 by 0.5 mb/d, mainly due to a weaker transportation fuel recovery than expected. The May y-o-y increase in oil demand resulted from rebounding transportation fuels, coming from a low baseline, and steady mobility data. The mobility index hovered around 103%, using January 2020 as a reference. Near-term expectations Going forward, the recent lockdown measures by Australian authorities in an attempt to contain the spread of the Delta variant will hamper the oil demand recovery. However, the impact is anticipated to be limited to the months of June and July, and a positive rebound is projected thereafter. Generally, regional lockdown measures may occur to contain the spread of new COVID-19 variants, causing possible downside risks to the 2021 oil demand outlook. However, OECD Asia Pacific’s 2021 oil demand is anticipated to rise, supported by a low baseline, along with steady petrochemical requirements and a transportation fuel recovery. Petrochemical feedstock demand is projected to encourage oil demand on the back of steady consumption for plastics and improving industrial sector requirements. In 2022, OECD Asia Pacific oil demand is anticipated increase by 0.2 mb/d, but remain below 2019 levels. Projections for 2022 are based on the assumption that the GDP will increase in all countries of the region, led by South Korea and Australia. Limited impact from COVID-19-related challenges on transportation fuel demand is anticipated, as herd immunity is projected to reach desired targets in 2022 amid an acceleration in vaccination rollouts. As such, gasoline is anticipated to increase the most, followed by diesel for the industrial sector. Petrochemical feedstock types LPG and naphtha are also projected to rise, supported by steady petrochemical margins and increased end-user demand. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments May oil demand data saw growth of around 1.0 mb/d Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change y-o-y compared with a rise of 1.6 mb/d y-o-y in April, mb/d largely due to the size of the baseline decline in April 2 and May of 2020.

It’s worth highlighting that motor vehicle sales showed an increase of 13.5% in May, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Jet fuel demand also posted gains of 0.3 mb/d y-o-y following an increase of 0.7 mb/d y-o-y in April and was at par with May 2019 levels. Improved air travel volume, especially in the domestic market, supported product recovery. Petrochemical feedstock, led by LPG, grew by roughly 0.4 mb/d y-o-y. LPG was supported by strong capacity additions at PDH plants and healthy cracker margins. 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 6: China’s oil demand*, mb/d Change May 21/May 20 By product May 20 May 21 Growth % LPG 1.91 2.27 0.36 18.8 Naphtha 1.00 1.08 0.08 8.4 Gasoline 2.75 3.32 0.58 21.0 Jet/kerosene 0.63 0.92 0.29 45.5 Diesel 3.29 3.15 -0.14 -4.2 Fuel oil 0.65 0.63 -0.02 -3.0 Other products 2.31 2.12 -0.19 -8.2 Total 12.53 13.49 0.96 7.7 Note: * Apparent oil demand.

Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand growth is anticipated to rise strongly in 2H21, driven by a healthy economic outlook and mobility returning to pre-pandemic levels, with strong control expected over COVID-19 cases. The main sectors of the economy are projected to show steady growth mainly in 2H21, as the overall health of the global economy improves and the impact of a low baseline in 1H21 subsides. Generally, the oil demand outlook for 2021 is based on the assumptions of increasing gasoline demand driven by developments in the economy, rising vehicle sales compared with 2020 and improving vehicles miles travelled. In terms of products, diesel demand is projected to show growth in 2021 due to developments in industrial, construction and agricultural activity, and due to a low baseline in 2020. Additionally, demand for light distillates should record healthy gains, driven by capacity development. In 2022, China’s oil demand is anticipated to increase by 0.5 mb/d for total demand to exceed 2019 figures, driven by robust economic growth projections. Oil demand in the transportation and industrial sectors is anticipated to continue increasing, supported by a steady rise in mobility, a growing passenger car fleet and firm industrial activity demand. Regarding fuels, gasoline is projected to increase the most next year followed by diesel. Petrochemical end-user demand is also anticipated to supported light distillate consumption. On the other hand, fuel quality programmes targeting fewer emissions and substitution by other fuels are projected to cap oil demand growth next year.

Transportation fuels were largely impacted by this slowdown in mobility, resulting in gasoline increasing by only 0.06 mb/d y-o-y in May, following an increase by 0.4 mb/d in April. However, gasoline was at more than 0.2 mb/d below May 2019 levels. Diesel was marginally positive as construction, trucking and agricultural activities were hit by a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and containment measures. Nevertheless, various developments, as well as early indicators for June, indicate a further recovery m-o-m.

Sources: JODI, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India and OPEC. Near-term expectations Recent oil demand data indicate positive m-o-m momentum as May’s surge in COVID-19 cases and accompanying challenges already started to ease. Improvements in mobility, industrial production activity and the resumption of overall economic activity are assumed to boost oil demand in 2H21. On the other hand, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases will pose a downside risk to oil demand until the end of the year. An acceleration in vaccination rates to reach targeted herd immunity will provide positive upside potential to oil demand over the short term. Oil demand is projected to pick up pace in 2H21, supported by diesel consumption in the construction and agricultural sectors and coming from a low 2020 baseline. Transportation fuels are anticipated to post respectable increases, though they will remain dependent on COVID-19 developments. Demand for transportation fuel is projected to account for the bulk of demand, followed by middle distillates. For 2022, India’s oil demand growth is anticipated to rise by around 0.3 mb/d, with total volumes expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels on an annualized basis. COVID-19 containment measures are projected to improve, backed by an acceleration in vaccination rollouts, natural immunization and better treatment of COVID-19. On the economic front, the country’s GDP is to increase solidly in 2022, supporting oil demand. From the product side, transportation fuels, led by gasoline, are projected to lead oil demand growth in 2022. Support will be driven by an increase in mobility through the use of private vehicles, particularly two wheelers that use gasoline as fuel. Diesel will gain strength in 2022, supported by healthy industrial, construction and agricultural activities. Other Asia Update on the latest developments Oil consumption has increased in Other Asia, recording a rise of 0.8 mb/d y-o-y in April after increasing by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in March. April data suggest a decline of 1.0 mb/d compared with April 2019, indicating that demand remained sharply lagging at 2019 levels. In Thailand, demand increased by 0.1 mb/d y-oy, Malaysia by 0.3 mb/d y-o-y, the Philippines by 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y, while Indonesia showed a marginal increase of 0.04 mb/d y-o-y. The y-o-y increase in petroleum product demand was led by diesel and transportation fuels, including gasoline and jet fuel, on the back of a low baseline and despite declining m-o-m mobility. Miles driven decreased in main consuming countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore compared with a month earlier. Diesel, which grew the most, was supported by an increase in trucking and agricultural activities, but remained largely impaired compared with 2019 levels. Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand is projected to improve y-o-y, supported by heathier y-o-y industrial development and a steady recovery in mobility. However, COVID-19 and the recent prevalence of a new variant in a number of countries in the region, such as Indonesia, will pose a downside risk to the forecast going into 2H21. In terms of countries, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines are projected to account for the bulk of gains. The transportation sector is projected to lead oil demand growth in Other Asia, with gasoline being the largest contributor, followed by on-road diesel. Additionally, demand for industrial fuels, including diesel and fuel oil, will be largely dependent on the recovery in economic activities in 2021. In 2022, Other Asia’s oil demand growth is expected to firmly increase by around 0.3 mb/d, with expectations based on firm GDP growth almost matching this year’s levels. Indonesia and Thailand are projected to be the 32 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Oil Demand main contributors to growth, with respectable contributions from Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Similar to other regions, transportation fuels are projected rise most in light of the projected better management of COVID-19 and improved mobility. Diesel will be the second product leading oil demand growth in 2022 and supporting the industrial sector. Latin America Update on the latest developments Latin America’s oil demand increased further in Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y April to show a rise of 0.7 mb/d y-o-y, following an change increase of more than 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in March. mb/d However, oil demand remained down compared with 1.0 April 2019 by 0.3 mb/d, with transportation fuels causing most of the decline.

Near-term expectations Going forward, an improvement in the mobility rate after a recent easing of restrictions is assumed to support demand going into 2H21. Demand is assumed to be dependent on developments around COVID-19 cases and how well the virus stays controlled through progressing vaccination programmes. However, some downside risks may pressure the oil demand recovery process, including hiccups in vaccination programmes, high unemployment rates and overall political tension, which may weigh on oil demand recovery over the short term. Generally, oil demand in the region is projected to rise as economic conditions improve, supporting industrial fuel demand. In terms of products, diesel is anticipated to grow the most, followed by gasoline, as the economy and mobility improve y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 33 World Oil Demand In 2022, oil demand in Latin America is projected to increase by nearly 0.2 mb/d, but will remain below 2019 levels. Growth will be more fully determined by developments in economic activity. The largest economy in the region, Brazil, is anticipated to be the main contributor to growth, with some contribution from Argentina, Venezuela and Ecuador. Transportation fuels are projected to rise the most in 2022, stemmed by further developments in the transportation sector, as containment measures for COVID-19 improve and the overall economy gains momentum. Moreover, construction and industrial fuels are also anticipated to gain pace in 2022.

Cement deliveries rose by 40.8% y-o-y in April, after posting growth of 4.1% y-o-y in March. It’s worth highlighting that indicators dropped by 28.8% in April 2020, as reported by the Yamama cement company and Haver analytics. This shows the continuation of a positive trend in the construction sector. In May, oil demand in Saudi Arabia continued to increase compared with the same time last year, adding 0.3 mb/d y-o-y, making up nearly 96% of lost demand from May 2020. Rebounding gasoline accounted for most of the gains, increasing by 0.2 mb/d y-o-y after posting similar gains in April. Middle distillate demand continued to expand, as both diesel and jet fuel gained around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, showing comparable gains to those made in April.

On the other hand, the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and prevalence of new variants will continue to create a downside risk. Gasoline demand is anticipated to continue improving over the summer driving season, while gasoil also rose on improved industrial activity 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Oil Demand and positive developments in infrastructure projects. A slow recovery in the aviation sector will continue to challenge jet fuel consumption and remain below 2019 levels. In 2022, Middle East oil demand growth is anticipated to gain further strength over the current year’s levels, to increase by around 0.3 mb/d amid sustained economic growth. In terms of countries, Saudi Arabia is anticipated to lead the oil demand increase in the region, driven by steady economic expectations, controlled COVID-19 cases and a healthy petrochemical sector. As a result, transportation fuels gasoline and on-road diesel, in addition to light distillates for petrochemical usage and construction fuels, are anticipated to be the products leading oil demand growth next year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 35 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 (including processing gains) was revised down by a minor 26 tb/d from the previous assessment, despite upward revisions to the US and Canada, and is now expected to grow by 0.81 mb/d to average 63.76 mb/d. The oil demand projection for 2021 was revised upward due to better-than-expected data for global vaccinations, in addition to higher oil demand growth expectations for 2022, which is leading to an expected gradual recovery in non-OPEC supply. Despite prices being higher than expected, none of the US independents raised capex guidance for 2021, as most available free cash flow was used to pay debts. Nevertheless, some US independents reinvested part of their operating cash flow, some kept investment plans in the exploration and production (E&P) sector on hold, and some have gone a step further and decided to halt production at mature fields to reduce cost. The US production growth forecast has been revised up slightly by 23 tb/d, owing to higher-than-anticipated production from April until now, with growth of 0.06 mb/d y-o-y. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, China, Norway and Brazil, and is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Egypt and the Sudans. Non-OPEC liquids production in 2022 is expected to grow by 2.1 mb/d to average 65.85 mb/d (including a recovery of 0.11 mb/d in processing gains). The supply forecast, including expected growth of OPEC NGLs, should be at 2.2 mb/d. Liquids supply in the OECD countries is expected to increase next year by 1.1 mb/d, and growth of 0.8 mb/d in the non-OECD region is anticipated. The main drivers for liquids supply growth are expected to be the US (0.74 mb/d), Russia, Brazil, Norway, Canada, Guyana and Kazakhstan, whereby the majority of the increase in the US and some other countries represents a production recovery from the 2020 oil market downturn due to curtailments, rather than growth from new projects. Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding the financial and operational aspects of US production remains high. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 is estimated to grow by 0.12 mb/d to average 5.17 mb/d. For 2022, it is likely to grow by 0.13 mb/d to average 5.29 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in June increased by 0.59 mb/d m-o-m to average 26.03 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids production in June, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have increased by 0.52 mb/d m-o-m to average 68.46 mb/d, up by 2.76 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply increased by 1.10 mb/d m-o-m to average 94.49 mb/d, down by 6.53 mb/d y-o-y. Main monthly revisions Non-OPEC liquids production growth in 2020 was Graph 5 1: Revisions on annual supply growth revised down by 48 tb/d owing to a downward revision forecast in 2021*, July MOMR/June MOMR in processing gains in all quarters, as well as to historical production in Colombia and Canada, and is Canada 24 now estimated to have declined by 2.58 mb/d to US 23 average 62.94 mb/d for the year.

For 2022, the key drivers for non-OPEC supply growth are forecast to be the US, Russia, Brazil, Norway, Canada, Guyana, Kazakhstan, China, India, Oman, Qatar, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil production will decline mainly in Egypt, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. Many institutes and agencies have forecast strong production growth for the next year, but with differing views of US and Russian production. Their near-term outlooks are mainly based on varying judgments regarding the continuation of financial and logistical circumstances in the US into 2022, and uncertainty over other countries’ production.

Average crude oil production in the first four months of the year from the US onshore Lower 48 (excluding Alaska), declined by 1.6 m/d y-o-y. Of this, 1.3 mb/d belongs to US tight oil. Production from the GoM also declined by 0.16 mb/d in the same period. From an operational point of view, US tight crude production improvements have been slowly progressing with the help of more oil rigs coming online. More than 200 oil rigs have been added since the lowest-ever point was reached in mid-August 2020, reaching 376 on 2 July 2021, although the figure is still far from the average of 671 seen in 1Q20 before the 2Q20 downturn in drilling activities. Meanwhile, despite fracking operations and well completions having shown a sudden jump of 25% in January 2021 from December 2020, they have not seen a remarkable rising trend so far in other months. On the contrary, the withdrawal of drilled, but uncompleted, (DUC) wells from the inventory of different shale regions indicates that shale operators are still struggling against a base decline and trying keep production flat through DUC completions. Drilling and well completion activities continued at a slow pace and are unlikely to reach y-o-y growth until 2022. The US Lower 48 – the key growth region and near-term driver for non-OPEC supply growth – is a key area that will suffer from decline in the long term. Nevertheless, US Lower 48 crude oil and NGLs supply is expected to rebound faster in 2022 from 2020-2021 lows, mainly due to favourable oil prices.

With the current trend in the weekly increase of drilling rigs, which is a good indicator for predicting future oil production, it does not seem that oil production in onshore fields will increase in 2021 compared to the previous year, and so long as the slope of this trend does not change, crude oil output will continue to grow steadily, but slowly in 2022, unless this trend accelerates significantly. Horizontal wells increased by 213 to now reach 433, and the overall drilling outlook remains healthy, but not sufficient to support strong growth.

Canada Canada’s liquids production in May showed a Graph 5 15: Canada's monthly production decline by 0.06 mb/d m-o-m to 5.14 mb/d, following development the continuation of maintenance and following a mb/d m-o-m drop of 0.34 mb/d in April. However, this was 2.0 less than the planned curtailment assumed in the 1.8 1.79 forecast. In May, while production of crude bitumen, 1.6 conventional crude and NGLs declined by 179 tb/d, 1.4 92 tb/d, and 26 tb/d, respectively, some 233 tb/d of 1.2 1.14 synthetic crude was recovered from upgraders m-o-m 1.12 1.0 1.06 during the seasonal roundabout to average 0.8 1.06 mb/d.

Hence, the forecast was revised up for 2Q21, leading to an overall upward revision of 24 tb/d in Canadian liquids output in 2021. This is now Conventional crude NGLs expected to grow by 0.31 mb/d y-o-y, which would Synthetic crude Bitumen make Canada the leader in non-OPEC supply growth Sources: National Energy Board and OPEC. for the current year. Canada’s total oil sands output, mainly in Alberta, rose to 2.85 mb/d in May, up by 54 tb/d m-o-m and 0.36 mb/d y-o-y, but down by 0.4 mb/d compared with January 2021, due to maintenance schedules. Despite heavierthan-normal turnarounds at a number of oil sands projects in 1H21, the forecast is for Canada’s total liquids to reach new record highs of 5.61 mb/d in 4Q21. Production will come from the expansion of existing, rather than new, projects. The lifting of Canadian government-ordered curtailments and the restart of oil sands expansion projects that were deferred in 2020 are the main drivers for increasing production in 2021. Despite the US revoking the presidential permit authorizing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in January 2021, which would have expanded Canadian crude oil capacity to the US by 830 tb/d, Canada’s pipeline export capacity is projected to be adequate through to the end of 2025. It is worth noting that Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement, with a capacity of 370 tb/d, will come online at the end of 2021. At the same time, the TransMountain expansion project, with a potential of 590 tb/d, will start transferring oil in 2022. These projects include additional expansion and optimization to Enbridge’s existing pipeline system, which can add a total of 400 tb/d of export capacity.

Latin America Latin America’s total liquids supply in May was down by 0.06 mb/d m-o-m to average 5.97 mb/d, mainly on the back of decreasing production in Brazil and Colombia. However, liquids output was up by 0.36 mb/d y-o-y. 46 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 World Oil Supply For 2021, liquids production has been revised down by 18 tb/d m-o-m and is projected to grow by 0.15 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.19 mb/d. Oil production in Brazil, Guyana, Ecuador, Argentina and Peru is forecast to increase, while declines are expected in Colombia and other countries in the region. Production in Ecuador is projected to recover by 0.03 mb/d after outages seen in 2020 to average 0.52 mb/d. Following a national strike and protests across Colombia, crude oil production was impacted through May and June by 60 tb/d vs 1Q21. If protests escalate or go on beyond June, production will continue to drop during 3Q21 as well. Oil production is likely to decline in Colombia by 0.03 mb/d, which has been revised down by 0.05 mb/d m-o-m. Production from the offshore Liza-1 project in Guyana returned to 0.11 mb/d in May after the operator fixed issues in offshore platform’s gas compressor in April. Oil production in Liza phase-1 in Guyana is expected to average 0.12 mb/d in 2021, with y-o-y growth of 0.04 mb/d. In Argentina, oil production is forecast to grow by 0.02 mb/d to average 0.68 mb/d. This should come mainly in the form of tight crude from Vaca Muerta, which is expected to grow by 29 tb/d in 2021 to average 137 tb/d. However, possible higher natural declines in mature fields may impact anticipated overall growth for the year. For 2022, Latin America’s total liquids supply forecast is projected to grow by 0.33 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.52 mb/d. One of the key drivers is Brazil, with expected growth of 0.23 mb/d, including biofuels, to average 3.99 mb/d. Guyana would be the second country in the region experiencing growth next year, through the start-up of Liza phase-2. Oil production in other countries in the region will decline, or see only minor growth. Brazil Brazil’s crude oil output in May fell by 0.04 mb/d m-o-m to average 2.93 mb/d, as total production in pre-salt areas declined by 0.18 mb/d. Crude oil output averaged 2.89 mb/d in the first five months of the year, down 79 tb/d y-o-y. In May, total liquids production was pegged at an average of 3.61 mb/d, including biofuels and NGLs, up by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y. It is estimated that crude oil output in June already passed the 3 mb/d level. Higher production by 0.3 mb/d in 2H21 is expected through continuation of the ramp-up of Búzios and Atapu. Moreover, the Sépia field (formerly Northeast Tupi), which is located in the pre-salt horizon in the Santos Basin, is planned to start production in 2H21. Nevertheless, Brazilian liquids supply in 2021, including biofuels, is unlikely to see growth of more than 0.09 mb/d y-o-y, to average 3.8 mb/d, due to weaker-than-expected output in 1H21.

Mero-1 (Guanabara) which was initially planned to start up in 2021, but was deferred to the next year due to delays in delivery of the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO). A final investment decision for the development of the Mero-1 area was reached in December 2017. The FPSO Guanabara, to be deployed in the Mero-1 area, is currently under construction. The processing capacity of the FPSO will be 180 tb/d of oil and 12 mcm of gas per day. The water injection capacity will be 225 tb/d, while the oil storage capacity will be 1.4 mb. The FPSO will be connected to 17 wells. Moreover, production in Brazil will be boosted through the restart of the Peregrino (South West) field, after operator Equinor halted production as a preventative measure to carry out safety inspections due to operational issues in a gas turbine and a riser in April 2020. Phase 2 will also be brought on stream in 2022 and will be developed through an additional wellhead platform, with production tied back to the existing FPSO. Brazil liquids supply forecast, including biofuels, is set to increase by 0.23 mb/d y-o-y in 2022 to average 3.99 mb/d.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 49 World Oil Supply World oil supply Preliminary data indicates that global liquids production in June increased by 1.10 mb/d to average 94.49 mb/d, compared with the previous month. Non-OPEC liquids production (including OPEC Graph 5 30: OPEC and world oil supply NGLs) increased in June by 0.52 mb/d compared with mb/d mb/d the previous month to average 68.46 mb/d, higher by 32 105 2.76 mb/d y-o-y.

The subsequent increases in product outputs in all main regions led to slower inventory drawdowns despite the current fuel market optimism attributed to the summer season. This growth in product availability along with the strong crude price environment exerted pressure on product crack spreads of most refined products and ultimately weighed on refining economics. Refinery margins USGC refining margins trended downwards as Graph 6 1: Refining margins refiners continued to increase run rates after a series US$/b of events constrained higher intakes over the previous 15 months. With the worst of the pandemic-induced demand contraction, the Gulf Coast freeze, the 10 Colonial pipeline shutdown, spring floods and, most 5 recently, the major turnaround season all behind, utilization rates rose significantly over the month. 0 Another supporting factor was the positive market sentiment surrounding gasoline markets given the -5 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 summer season with reports of road traffic having recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In the near term, run rates are expected to remain high to allow product WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) stock up ahead of hurricane season, however, Oman (Singapore) eventually, this may be unsustainable. US refinery Sources: Argus and OPEC. margins for WTI averaged $11.90/b in June, down by $2.20 m-o-m but up by $6.71 y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe declined as rising refinery run rates led to stronger product output in the region. This had a negative impact on product crack spreads, particularly that of gasoline and fuel oil, despite the relaxation of lockdown measures, which provided some support, mainly to middle distillates. Meanwhile, European air travel continued to rise to eight-month highs in June, with commercial flights recovering to the highest level since early November 2020. Additional support stemmed from the gasoil segment as strong industrial activity prompted significant gasoil drawdowns. Nonetheless, the strength provided by middle distillate markets in the US was rather insufficient to offset the negative impact linked to weak regional demand and exports at the top and bottom sections of the barrel, which was exacerbated by the rise in product output as refineries returned from maintenance. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $1.01/b in June, down by $1.12 compared with a month earlier, but up by 59¢ y-o-y. In Asia, margins lost some ground, although by the smallest magnitude relative to the other regions, pressured by stronger product outputs. China’s state-run refineries’ crude runs rose to 4-month highs with the average utilization rate of China’s four state-owned refineries up by 2.0 pp to a four-month high of 82.4% in June as more plants restarted from scheduled maintenance. In India, domestic fuel sales by state refiners recovered in the first half of June, as lockdown restrictions eased, with gasoline sales up 13% and diesel sales up 12%, compared with the same period last month. Meanwhile, gasoil sales, which account for about two-fifths of India's overall refined fuel consumption and are directly linked to industrial activity in Asia's third-largest economy, rose by 18.5% from May to 5.36 million tonnes, but were down 1.84% from June 2020. Despite the improvement in fuel fundamentals in India, stronger crude prices were an additional factor, which, coupled with high throughputs in China and lower product exports as refiners in other regions returned from maintenance, all combined led to the weaker refining economics in the region. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia lost 52¢ m-o-m to average 94¢/b in June, which was higher by $1.69 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased in June to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 92.6%, which corresponds to a throughput of % 16.75 mb/d.

US gasoline crack spreads lost $2.00 m-o-m to average $24.16 in June, down by $8.84/b y-o-y. USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads lost some ground as jet fuel inventories grew further and showed an increase for the ninth consecutive week. Although air travel passenger counts were reported higher, the overshoot in throughput and the subsequent stock builds prevented any upturn in jet/kerosene markets in the US. The ongoing recovery in domestic flight activity is set to continue trending upward, although international travel segments appear to remain under pressure, exacerbated by the spread of the new Delta COVID variant. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $7.35/b, down by $1.40 m-o-m, but up by $20.30 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI came under pressure, affected by weaker fundamentals, although the shift to higher light end yields by US refiners helped US diesel markets perform relatively better m-o-m compared to gasoline. The easing of lockdown restrictions in European markets may trigger additional export volumes out of the US and provide support to US gasoil markets in the near term. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $4.25/b, down by 29¢ m-o-m and by $4.27 y-o-y. US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI weakened, affected by a sustained surplus of international fuel oil supplies due to higher crude runs. In addition, the lingering effect of strong HSFO imports from Europe/Russia recorded in the previous month also contributed to the downturn in HSFO crack spreads despite improvement in fuel oil processing rates in secondary units given supportive coker margins. Going forward, the weakness 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations in fuel oil markets could trigger additional fuel oil buying interest as secondary feedstock given the current strong gasoline pricing signals, as well as the transport fuel optimism linked to the summer season. This should limit the fuel oil downturn in the near term. In June, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $4.24/b lower m-o-m but was down by $10.12 y-o-y.

The gasoline crack spread against Brent averaged $14.16/b in June, down by 48<U+023C> m-o-m but up by $4.49 y-o-y. Jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent managed to show gains, contrary to what was seen in other markets, and were supported by an improvement in fundamentals. The number of flights increased by nearly 75% between mid-May and late June across Europe’s major countries. The number of daily flights in the UK and Germany is still 60 to 70% below 2019 levels, while flights in Greece and Turkey are recovering quicker. A fall in COVID cases as well as growing interest for summer travel have boosted air traffic to countries open for tourism. Moreover, Europe’s jet fuel deficit increased due to lower imports from Asia and the Middle East. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $5.29/b, up by 58<U+023C> m-o-m and by $4.11 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads reached their highest outright value since December 2019 amid rallying crude oil prices and rapid COVID-19 vaccine rollout programmes. The gains seen since the start of June in the front-month swap have been driven by a positive outlook for global oil demand, as well as projections of higher fuel consumption in the US and Europe during summer. Gasoil crack spreads were the main driver for the support to margins with the strongest positive performance relative to other refined product market within the region, albeit limited in absolute terms. Further support may arise from lower gasoil/diesel departures from Russia. However, higher regional processing rates going forward could exert pressure on crack gains. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $6.80/b, which was higher by 74¢ m-o-m and higher by $2.32 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads continued to trend downwards in line with robust improvements in refinery throughput across Europe driven by a rapid recovery in transportation fuels demand, which is already exerting sizeable supply-side pressure to global HSFO markets. The recent improvement in clean product cracks have helped conversion margins move higher. Moreover, higher HSFO volume deliveries out of Europe/Russia to the US pointed to a sizeable increase in residue processing in the US refining system. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $3.70/b in June, having lost 26¢ m-o-m but gained 50<U+023C> y-o-y.

Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene Gasoil Fuel oil Sources: Argus and OPEC. Asia naphtha crack spreads weakened and entered negative territory affected by a sharp widening of the gasoline/naphtha spread to a 13-month high. Seasonal naphtha demand is relatively low due to regular steam cracker maintenance and has been further pressured by an unexpected slowdown of PTTGC’s Mab Ta Phut steam crackers in Thailand due to problems with power supply, according to Argus Media. Japan has been increasingly importing naphtha over the last few months, with February and March imports averaging around 140,000 b/d (35%) higher than in 2020, and over 100,000 b/d (27%) higher vs. 2020 in May. Going forward, Asian naphtha markets are expected to remain well supported by the petrochemical industry with the conclusion of steam cracker maintenance. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged minus 86<U+023C>/b, having decreased by 39¢ m-o-m, but increased by 79<U+023C> y-o-y. In the middle of the barrel, the jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia lost some ground pressured by stronger jet fuel availability, amid lower exports despite continued regional requirements for domestic air travel mainly in China. The majority of international flights remain suspended due to prolonged border restrictions amid outbreaks of the new COVID variant in many parts of Asia, while business travel is still being avoided as much as possible. Jet fuel supplies in the region have grown as refiners have increased jet/kerosene production. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged minus $4.41/b, down by 89<U+023C> m-o-m but up by $3.96 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spreads moved lower as well with a strong rise in exports of gasoil/diesel from the region’s largest exporters such as India, China, Korea and Taiwan. One country facing challenges to place barrels into export markets is Japan, where a lack of local demand has resulted in considerable diesel stock builds. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $4.81/b, up by $0.46/b m-o-m but down by $2.71 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spreads continued to trend downwards, affected by stronger fuel oil output rates. Meanwhile, China’s recent decision to impose consumption taxes on light cycle oil, mixed aromatics and diluted bitumen, as well as a regulatory push from the government to reduce crude import quotas for independent refiners will likely be supportive to domestic fuel oil markets going forward. In addition, a seasonal uptick in requirements from the power generation sector in the coming months should add to the support in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $8.88/b, down by 17¢ m-o-m and by $2.83 y-o-y. 54 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Table 6 1: Short-term prospects for product markets and refinery operations Time Event Asia Europe US Observations frame Relaxation of Aug 21 <U+F0E9> Positive <U+F0E9> Positive <U+F0E9> Positive Seasonality as well as relaxation of the hard impact on impact on impact on the lockdowns could support fuel lockdowns product product product markets in the immediate near markets markets markets term.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 57 Tanker Market Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates remained at depressed levels in June as ample tonnage availability and constrained demand continued to weigh on the market. The search for better rates has even encouraged the use of newly built very large crude carriers (VLCCs) to carry clean products, eroding clean tanker rates. New deliveries, minimal scrapping and weak tanker demand point to a continued sluggish tanker market, possibly into next year. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in June, falling by 1.6 mb/d, or around 10%, to average around 14 mb/d. Declines in flows to East Asia and India were partly offset by a pickup in flows to Europe. Compared to the previous year, spot fixtures were around 1.0 mb/d, or almost 7%, lower than the same month last year.

OPEC spot fixtures fell m-o-m in June, down by 1.5 mb/d, or a little over 14%, to average 8.9 mb/d, amid lower flows to China and India. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were almost 10% lower, down by just under 1.0 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-West provided a minor bright spot for the month, averaging 1.0 mb/d in June, representing a marginal increase of 3% m-o-m, amid increased flows to Europe. Y-o-y, the route saw an increase of 0.3 mb/d, or almost 48%. Middle East-to-East fixtures declined by almost 17%, or around 1.0 mb/d m-o-m, to average close to 5.1 mb/d. The decrease came amid lower flows to China and India, which were offset by higher flows to Japan and South Korea. This was almost 1.1 mb/d, or 17%, lower than in the same month last year. Outside Middle East fixtures fell by 0.5 mb/d, or close to 15% m-o-m, to average 2.8 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were down by just over 7%, or around 0.2 mb/d.

Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates edged lower m-o-m in June, down 7%, and were some 36% lower compared with the same month last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-East declined 6% m-o-m to average WS32 points, as flows to China remained muted. Y-o-y, rates were 37% below the same month last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route also declined m-o-m, dropping 5% in June to stand at WS21 points, as ample availability outweighed a slight increase in fixtures. Y-o-y, rates were 30% lower. The West Africa-to-East route showed a loss of 8% m-o-m in June, averaging WS33, as uncertainties regarding crude import quotas constricted buying by Chinese independents.

US crude imports rose 0.7 mb/d m-o-m, or more than 11%, to average 6.7 mb/d in June, the highest since December 2019. US crude exports also rose sharply m-o-m in June, jumping 0.8 mb/d or almost 30%, to average 3.6 mb/d, the second-highest on record. China’s crude oil imports averaged 9.7 mb/d in May, representing a further decline of 0.2 mb/d or 2% m-o-m and a cumulative decline of 2.1 mb/d or 18% over the last two months. Preliminary customs figures for June show the country’s crude imports ticking up, but remaining below 10 mb/d. Product imports moved higher for the second consecutive month, while product exports fell sharply m-o-m in May, down from an 11-month high the month before, driven by strong declines in gasoil as well as jet fuel and fuel oil. India’s crude imports fell to a seven-month low in May, as the peak of the second COVID-19 wave arrived in the middle of the month. With reduced COVID-19 infections at the end of June, refiners in India began to slowly lift run rates which could strengthen crude inflows in July. Signs that driving activity is picking up despite higher prices at the pump could help boost product imports and ease the high level of outflows in July. Japan’s crude imports fell back in May from the strong levels seen the month before, averaging 2.4 mb/d, as renewed lockdown measures undermined expectations for product demand. The start of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in July should provide some boost to crude and product imports, although uncertainty regarding COVID-19 measures are clouding product needs. The most recent official data shows OECD Europe crude imports rebounded from an eight-month low the month before to average 7.8 mb/d in March. OECD Europe’s waterborne crude imports were seen higher q-o-q in 2Q21 supported by stronger flows to Italy. Crude exports from OECD Europe are expected to remain below the high levels seen in January through 2Q21, amid reduced flows to China. US The US provided key seasonal support for global trade flows in June, according to preliminary data. US crude imports rose 0.7 mb/d m-o-m, or more than 11%, to average 6.7 mb/d in June, the highest since December 2019. The return of economic activity following the lifting of lockdown measures has boosted demand for crude and products, resulting in inventory draws and higher imports. Compared to the same month last year, crude imports were 0.3 mb/d or almost 5% higher.

The increase was led by higher flows to South Korea and well as further spot cargoes to India. Compared to the same month last year, crude exports were about 0.9 mb/d higher, a gain of around 32%. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 61 Crude and Refined Products Trade The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination for April shows higher flows to Europe. The Netherlands’ purchases of US crude averaged 400 tb/d, up from 200 tb/d the month before. Italy and the UK also received more flows of US crude. In contrast, US crude exports to China declined by 140 tb/d to 350 mb/d. US net crude imports averaged 3.1 mb/d in June, compared to 3.2 mb/d the month before and 3.6 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US product imports remaining close to an 11-month high in June, averaging 2.7 mb/d. M-o-m, imports were 2% lower, but were some 0.7 mb/d or 37% higher compared to the same month last year. US product exports were broadly unchanged m-o-m in June, averaging 5.4 mb/d, representing a marginal increase of less than 1% m-o-m. Y-o-y, product exports were 0.5 mb/d, or almost 10%, higher. As a result, US net product exports averaged 2.7 mb/d in June, in line with the previous month but below the almost 3.0 mb/d registered in June 2020. Preliminary data indicates that the US remained a net crude and product importer in June, with net inflows of over 0.3 mb/d. This compares with net imports of almost 0.6 mb/d the month before and 0.7 mb/d in June 2020. Looking ahead, the ongoing economic recovery and easing of lockdown measures in the US are expected to continue to provide support for crude imports. Meanwhile, the narrowing Brent/WTI spread could weigh on Asia-bound crude exports in 3Q21, despite depressed freight rates.

China China’s crude oil imports averaged 9.7 mb/d in May, representing a further decline of 0.2 mb/d or almost 2% m-o-m and a cumulative decline of 2.1 mb/d or 18% over the last two months. Preliminary customs figures for June show the country’s crude imports ticking up, but remaining below 10 mb/d. Crude flows into China were expected to be lower throughout 2Q21 before picking up again in 3Q21. Compared to the same month last year, crude imports in May were 1.7 mb/d or almost 15% lower than the elevated levels seen in the same month last year. Refinery maintenance has been a factor limiting flows as well as higher inflows of blendand feed-stocks, which are not included in the crude import numbers. China’s independent refiners have increasingly been importing blendand feedstocks, as until recently they have not been subject to import taxes and quotas. These include bitumen blend, which is used in asphalt production; mixed aromatics, which are used to produce gasoline; and light cycle oil (LCO), which is used to make an industrial gasoil. Combined imports of these blend-/feed stocks have risen in recent years, increasing from 0.3 mb/d annually in 2019 to 0.7 mb/d in 2020, according to customs data reported by S&P Global Platts. Ahead of a new tax in June, combined imports surged in May to 1.4 mb/d, with preliminary data for June showing inflows sharply lower, but at a still-elevated level. With a new tax imposed on these blend and feedstocks as of 12 June 2021, imports should taper further in the months ahead, slightly boosting demand for crude imports and dampening gasoil exports as the blended version becomes less available for domestic consumption. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia remained in the top position in May, with a share of close to 18%. Russia came in second with 13% followed by Iraq and Oman with 11% and 10%, respectively. Product imports moved higher for the second consecutive month, up 0.1 mb/d or 8% m-o-m to average almost 1.5 mb/d in May. Gains were seen across most major products, but particularly LPG. Compared to the same month last year, product imports in May were 0.4 mb/d or 19% lower. China’s product exports fell sharply m-o-m in May, down from an 11-month high the month before. Product exports declined 0.4 mb/d or around 22% compared to the previous month, averaging 1.4 mb/d, driven by strong declines in gasoil as well as jet fuel and fuel oil.

Net product imports averaged 0.1 mb/d, compared to net exports of 0.4 mb/d the month before and net imports of 0.9 mb/d in the same month last year. Looking ahead, China’s crude imports are expected to be capped close to current levels as refiners prefer to draw from available inventories. Meanwhile, stricter oversight of refinery activities is likely to support domestic consumption of major products, keeping product exports low.

Product inflows for the month were 0.1 mb/d or over 11% lower m-o-m with declines registered across all major products, particularly fuel oil and gasoline, reflecting the impact of lockdown measures. Y-o-y, product imports were 0.3 mb/d, or 27%, lower. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 63 Crude and Refined Products Trade In contrast, product exports jumped 42% m-o-m or 0.4 mb/d in May, to average 1.4 mb/d as constrained domestic consumption left products available for export. Gains were registered across all major categories, particularly gasoil and gasoline. Y-o-y, product exports were broadly flat. As a result, May net product exports were the highest in 13 months, with net outflows rising to 562 tb/d. This compares to net exports of just 31 tb/d the month before and 241 tb/d in May 2020. Looking ahead, with declining COVID-19 infections at the end of June, refiners have begun to slowly lift run rates, which could strengthen crude inflows in July. On the product side, signs that driving activity is picking up despite higher prices at the pump could help boost product imports in July.

Product imports including LPG were relatively steady for the third month in a row, averaging 1.0 mb/d, with the gains in gasoline and gasoil offsetting declines in naphtha and fuel oil. Compared to the same month last year, product imports rose by just over 9%. Product exports including LPG declined 9% m-o-m to average 0.3 mb/d in May, led by losses in gasoline and fuel oil, which offset jet fuel exports which reached the highest in over a year. Compared to the previous year, product exports fell more than 18%. As a consequence, Japan’s net product imports averaged 0.8 mb/d in May, compared to 0.7 mb/d in the previous month and 0.6 mb/d in May 2020. Looking ahead, preparations for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, scheduled to begin on 23 July, may provide some boost to consumption, although uncertainty following recently announced lockdown measures is clouding product needs. 64 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – July 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Table 8 4: Japan’s crude and product net imports, tb/d Change Japan Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 May 21/Apr 21 Crude oil 2,344 2,653 2,416 -237 Total products 612 739 771 31 Total crude and products 2,956 3,392 3,187 -205 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding.

This represents a gain of 0.4 mb/d or around 6% m-o-m. Compared to the same month last year, crude inflows were 1.3 mb/d or 14% lower. Crude exports to the OECD Europe slipped 2% in March to average 0.6 mb/d, on decreased Norway flows, particularly to China. Y-o-y, crude inflows were 0.1 mb/d, or more than 26%, higher. As a result, net crude imports averaged almost 7.2 mb/d in March, up from 6.8 mb/d the month before but lower than the 8.7 mb/d recorded in the same month of 2020. On the product side, imports recovered some of the decline seen in the previous month, averaging 2.8 mb/d. M-o-m, product inflows were 0.2 mb/d or 7% higher, with gains primarily driven by fuel oil. Y-o-y, OECD Europe product imports were 0.3 mb/d, or 12%, lower. Product exports remained near 18-month highs, averaging 2.8 mb/d, as declines in diesel and fuel oil offset by increases in motor gasoline. Outflows were less than 1% lower m-o-m.
