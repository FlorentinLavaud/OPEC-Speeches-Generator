Refiners in most regions showed increases in buying interest on the expectation of a further oil demand recovery with the approach of the summer driving season. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) increased by $3.67, or 5.8%, m-o-m in May to average $66.61/b, the highest since May 2019. Year-to-date, the ORB was up 56.8%, averaging $62.16/b, compared to $39.65/b on average over the first five months of 2020. Crude oil futures prices rose in May, with ICE Brent increasing $2.98, or 4.6%, to average $68.31/b, and NYMEX WTI gaining $3.45, or 5.6%, to an average of $65.16/b. Consequently, the Brent-WTI spread narrowed 47¢ to average $3.15/b in May. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in sustained backwardation. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced their net long positions for crude futures and options in May, mainly for Brent. World Economy The global economic growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 5.5%, although the forecast continues to be impacted by uncertainties including the spread of COVID-19 variants and the speed of the global vaccine rollouts. In addition, sovereign debt levels in many regions, inflationary pressures and central bank responses remain key factors to monitor. US economic growth in 2021 is revised up slightly to stand at 6.4%, following a contraction of 3.5% in 2020. The economic growth forecast for the Euro-zone in 2021 is lowered slightly to stand at 4.1%, following a contraction of 6.7% last year. Similarly, Japan’s economic growth forecast is lowered to 2.8% for 2021, following a contraction of 4.7% in 2020. After growth of 2.3% in 2020, China’s economic growth forecast in 2021 remains at 8.5%. Given the ongoing COVID-19 related challenges, India’s 2021 economic growth forecast is revised down slightly to 9.5%, following the contraction of 7.0% in 2020. Brazil’s growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 3.0%, following a contraction of 4.1% in 2020. Russia’s forecast for 2021 remains at 3.0%, following a contraction of 3.1% in 2020. World Oil Demand World oil demand is now estimated to have declined by 9.3 mb/d in 2020, a slight improvement of 0.1 mb/d on last month’s estimate, mainly reflecting the most up-to-date data for both the OECD and non-OECD regions. Total global oil demand is expected to average 90.6 mb/d. For 2021, world oil demand growth is kept unchanged at 6.0 mb/d, with total oil demand standing at 96.58 mb/d. OECD demand is revised slightly lower on an annualized basis, mainly reflecting lower-than-expected data from OECD Americas and Europe in 1Q21. However, initial data for April in both regions, as well as positive mobility developments given easing restriction measures and border openings, encouraged an upward revision to 2Q21 data. This offset most of the 1Q21 downward revision. In the non-OECD, oil demand was revised slightly higher, mainly due to positive 2Q21 data from the Middle East. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2020 is estimated to average 62.9 mb/d, representing a y-o-y contraction of 2.5 mb/d. For 2021, non-OPEC liquids supply is revised up by 0.1 mb/d from last month’s assessment, and is now forecast to grow by 0.8 mb/d to average 63.7 mb/d. This is mainly due to a faster-than-expected recovery in US liquids production of 2.5 mb/d in March. Additionally, the supply forecast for Norway, China, and Indonesia is also revised up, while the supply forecast in the UK, Brazil and Colombia is revised down. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are anticipated to be Canada, Brazil, China and Norway, while US liquids supply is now expected to only grow by a marginal 0.03 mb/d y-o-y. US crude oil is actually forecast to decline y-o-y by 0.1 mb/d to 11.2 mb/d. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 to average 5.2 mb/d, following an estimated contraction of 0.2 mb/d in 2020. OPEC crude oil production in May increased m-o-m by 0.39 mb/d, to average 25.46 mb/d, according to available secondary sources to date. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights Product Markets and Refining Operations Refinery margins showed diverging trends in May. Margins increased in the US Gulf Coast (USGC) were supported by unplanned refinery outages which limited the stronger recovery in run rates and kept product output relatively supressed. In contrast, Europe and Asia margins performed negatively as refining economics showed losses. Pressure came mainly from the top and bottom-sections of the barrel, reflecting rising product output rates. Global capacity offline fell considerably in May, with trends indicating the end of peak refinery turnaround season, and hence run rates are expected to be strong over the coming months. Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates saw mixed movement in May, although they remain at low levels. Improving US market supported rates on the UK-US route, while very low rates on the Mideast-Asia Pacific route edged-up amid anticipation of the end of seasonal maintenance. Meanwhile, clean rates were largely steady. There has been a slight improvement in sentiment for the outlook for dirty tanker rates in 2H21, although scrapping will still need to pickup to better balance tonnage supply with demand for cargoes. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d in May to average 6.0 mb/d, the highest in 11 months. US crude exports dipped again, averaging 2.8 mb/d in May, amid lower buying from the Asian region. With the start of the driving season and a pick-up in economic activity, US crude and product trade flows will provide a key support for the market in the coming months, together with OECD Europe. Tracking data shows a steady increase in OECD Europe crude imports since February and crude exports declined, amid lower production and improving demand in 2Q21 given the easing of lockdown measures. China’s crude imports dropped to just below 10 mb/d in April, amid planned refinery maintenance, with a further decline in May to a five-month low of 9.65 mb/d seen in preliminary data. China’s crude imports are expected to remain low in 2Q21, before picking up again in 3Q21. Stricter oversight of refinery activities and the end of a tax loophole is likely to weigh on both product imports and exports in the coming few months. Meanwhile, India’s crude imports recovered from a five-month low in April to average 4.5 mb/d. The vicious surge in COVID-19 cases which reached record levels in May will likely weigh on demand for crude imports for May and June, with local refiners expecting the situation to improve in July. Constrained domestic consumption could free up product for exports over the period. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data shows that total OECD commercial oil stocks fell m-o-m by 6.4 mb in April. At 2,962 mb, inventories were 160 mb lower than the same month a year ago, 25 mb below the latest five-year average, and around 34 mb higher than the 2015–2019 average. Within the components, crude stocks fell m-o-m by 13.6 mb, while product stocks rose 7.2 mb. OECD crude stocks stood at 1,475 mb in April, which is 36 mb less than the latest five-year average and 8 mb lower than the 2015–2019 average. Product stocks stood at 1,487 mb, which represents a surplus of 11 mb compared to the latest five-year average and 43 mb higher than the 2015–2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial inventories declined m-o-m by 0.9 days in April to stand at 66.0 days. This is 12.3 days lower than the year-ago level, some 0.5 days above the latest five-year average, and 3.9 days above the 2015–2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2020 is revised up by 0.2 mb/d from last month’s assessment to stand at 22.7 mb/d, which is 6.6 mb/d lower than in 2019. For 2021, demand for OPEC crude is forecast to stand at 27.7 mb/d, unchanged from last month’s assessment and around 5.0 mb/d higher than in 2020. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 Feature Article Feature Article World oil market prospects for 2H2021 Global economic recovery has been delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and renewed lockdowns in key economies, including the Euro-zone, Japan and India, which kept growth rates low in 1H21. However, the ongoing vaccination efforts, growing share of recovered cases leading to increasing herd immunity, and the easing of lockdown restrictions lend optimism that the pandemic could be contained in the few months to come. These developments, combined with broad-based Graph 1: World GDP growth stimulus measures, high savings rates in advanced % economies, and pent-up demand following the 6 lockdowns, are expected to add momentum to the 5.5 economic rebound towards the end of 2Q21. 5 Consumption is forecast to improve, particularly in 4 the contact-intensive sectors, and investment is anticipated to rise, with the stabilization of crude oil 3 2.6 markets expected to add further upside in some 1.9 producer countries, including the US. Consequently, 2 1.4 GDP growth rates in 2H21 are forecast to 1 0.4 significantly exceed that of 1H21 (Graph 1). The ongoing fiscal stimulus in the US, amounting to 0 almost $3 trillion, or more than 3% of global GDP, is 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* FY 2021** one very important supporting factor, as is China’s Note: * q-o-q and ** y-o-y. Source: OPEC. successful containment of COVID-19 and the country’s consequent swift economic recovery. However, numerous challenges remain. New virus variants and/or mutations could diminish, or even neutralize, ongoing containment strategies. Moreover, a strong recovery could lead to rising inflation and a necessary reduction of monetary stimulus, resulting in higher interest rates. Moreover, very high sovereign debt levels amid rising interest rates could pose a burden on the fiscal health of many economies. Turning to the oil market, global oil demand is also anticipated to pick up pace in 2H21, reaching 99.0 mb/d, compared to 94.1 mb/d in 1H21, with improving mobility in major economies supporting gasoline and onroad diesel demand. Improvements in pandemic containment efforts and seasonal summer demand will allow for positive expectations for 2H21. On a regional basis, OECD oil demand is anticipated to grow by 3.1 mb/d in 2H21 y-o-y, as oil demand gains traction, especially in OECD Americas, the largest contributor to oil demand growth in 2021. However, oil demand in the region is not expected to fully recover from the 2020 contraction. Transportation fuels, mainly gasoline, as well as light and middle distillates are assumed to support the oil demand recovery going forward. In the non-OECD, oil demand is estimated to grow by 3.0 mb/d in 2H21 y-o-y, driven by China, India and Other Asia. A healthy rebound in economic momentum is anticipated to stimulate industrial fuel demand, while demand for petrochemical feedstock is also projected to support demand growth in 2021. Following an estimated growth of 1.1 mb/d in 1H21 Graph 2: World oil demand and Non-OPEC supply, compared with 2H20, non-OPEC oil supply, y-o-y changes including OPEC NGLs, is forecast to grow by mb/d 2.1 mb/d in 2H21 compared with 1H21, which is up 15 by 3.2 mb/d y-o-y. For the entire year, non-OPEC liquids supply is forecast to grow by 0.84 mb/d 10 y-o-y (Graph 2). On a regional basis, some 1.6 mb/d 6.0 out of total incremental production of 2.1 mb/d in 5 2H21 is expected to come from the OECD region, 0.8 mainly from the US with 1.1 mb/d and the rest from 0 Canada and Norway. At the same time, liquids supply growth from the non-OECD regions is -5 forecast at only 0.4 mb/d in 2H21. 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 2021 Overall, the recovery in global economic growth, and World oil demand Non-OPEC supply hence oil demand, are expected to gain momentum Note: 2021 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. in 2H21. At the same time, the successful efforts of the DoC have substantially led the way towards a market rebalance. This foresight, along with an ongoing joint vigilant monitoring of developments, continues to support the oil market, in tandem with the expected recovery in the various economic sectors.

Refiners in Asia Pacific and Europe showed higher buying interests on the expectation of further recovery of oil demand in the approach of the summer driving season. In the US, the continued recovery in refinery runs and declining crude stock lent support to prices. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) value rose firmly in May increasing by $3.67, or 5.8% m-o-m, to stand at $66.91/b, its highest monthly average since May 2019. This was on the back of higher ORB componentrelated crude benchmarks, given rises in official selling prices and crude differentials. Compared to the previous year, the ORB was up 56.8%, from $39.65/b in 2020 to an average of $62.16/b so far this year. Crude oil futures prices rebounded in May after traders turned more optimistic about a further recovery in oil demand and accelerating global oil market rebalancing and oil destocking. Investors’ optimism bolstered by accelerating COVID-19 vaccination in western countries along with easing mobility restriction, which overshadowed the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in several Asian countries in May, specifically India and to less extend Japan. The decision of OPEC and non-OPEC producers in the DoC to gradually adjust their production from May to July has supported market confidence. The ICE Brent front month increased by $2.98 m-o-m, or 4.6%, in May to average $68.31/b, and NYMEX WTI rose by $3.45 m-o-m, or 5.6%, to average $65.16/b. ICE Brent was $21.14 higher y-t-d, or 49.9%, at $63.52/b, while NYMEX WTI was $23.75 higher, or 65.1%, at $60.25/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in May by $3.17 m-o-m, or 5.0%, to settle at $66.44/b. Year-to-date (y-t-d), DME Oman was higher by $20.29, or 48.4%, from the same period of last year, registering $62.18/b. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced their futures and options net-long positions in crude by 7.8% last month and were net sellers of about 53 mb between the week of 27 April and 25 May. Speculators continued to be cautious regarding their positions in ICE Brent amid surging COVID-19 infections in some Asian countries, specifically in India. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in sustained backwardation in May as the oil markets continue to tighten and investors turning optimistic about further oil demand recovery in the summer holiday season. The sweet/sour crude differential widened in Asia and the USGC in May on the relatively better performance of light sweet crudes. In Europe, the spread narrowed, although it remained wide. The better performance of light distillate products, specifically gasoline, compared to heavier distillates like fuel oil, contributed in widening the sweet/sour crude differential. Crude spot prices The price of the three major spot benchmarks Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement recorded solid gains in May, rising about 6% on US$/b average m-o-m, to settle at multi-month highs. The 80 spot market fundamentals showed signs of strength in May with refiners in the Asia Pacific and Europe 60 manifested higher buying interests on the expectation of further recovery of oil demand in the approach of 40 the summer holidays season, and as further states 20 across Europe and the US are easing mobility restrictions. In the US, refiner net input of crude oil 0 continued to increase in May reaching 15.6 mb/d in the week to 28 May, its highest level since March May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 2020, according to the EIA weekly report, pointing to continuing demand recovery in the largest oil OPEC Basket North Sea Dated WTI consuming country. Strengthening buying interest Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. from Chinese refiners for crude in the Atlantic Basin, as well as the return of some Indian refiners to the market and easing of the COVID-19 situation in India later in the month gave additional support to spot prices. Furthermore, the decision of OPEC and participating OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements non-OPEC producers in the DoC to gradually adjust their production until end July has lent support to the market. Data showed OECD oil stocks fell again in April for several months of decline, in a sign of balanced supply/demand fundamentals. The North Sea Dated benchmark rose by $4.05 m-o-m, or 6.3%, to settle at $68.51/b, while the Dubai and WTI first months increased by $3.49 m-o-m and $3.52, or 5.5% and 5.7%, respectively, to settle at $66.41/b and $65.23/b. A sign of the strengthening physical market is the rise of North Sea Dated compared to futures benchmark ICE Brent by $1.07 in May, settling at a premium of 20 ¢/b in May, compared to a discount of 87¢/b in April. The North Sea Dated premium to ICE Brent in May was at its highest level since December 2019.

Crude differentials also strengthened in May in almost all markets and for all crude qualities. In the North Sea, crude differentials showed further improvement last month amid firm regional crude demand and low supply that continued for several months, although the North Sea crude supply is expected to rise slightly in June. The forties and Ekofisk crude differentials rose 74¢ m-o-m and 49¢, respectively, on a monthly average in May to settle at premiums of 80¢/b and 90¢/b. West African crude differentials also rose in May, supported by renewed demand from Asia Pacific despite a wide EFS Dubai, as well as demand from some European refiners. On a monthly average, crude differentials to North Sea Dated benchmark of Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe rose by 9¢ m-o-m, 21¢, and 15¢, respectively in May, to settle at discounts of 79¢/b, 49¢/b, and 91¢/b. Angolan crude differentials also rose on demand from China and low loading program. The crude differential of mediumheavy sweet crude Cabinda rose in May by 26¢ m-o-m, on average to a discount of 21¢/b. in the Mediterranean, Saharan Blend, Azeri light, and CPC Blend saw their crude differentials increasing respectively by 23¢ m-o-m, 6¢, and 25¢. In the Middle East, firm demand from Asian refiners, restrained supply of sour crude, and wide Brent-Dubai front-month exchange of futures for swaps (EFS) continued to support the market. The value of the Oman crude differential was little changed in May easing 2¢ m-o-m in May, to stand at a premium of $1.22/b, while the Upper Zakum crude differential rose 10¢, to settle at a discount of 6¢/b. 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB value rose firmly in May, increasing by $3.67 m-o-m, or 5.8%, to stand at $66.91/b, its highest monthly average since May 2019. This was on the back of higher ORB component-related crude benchmarks, and an increase in official selling prices and crude differentials, amid a healthier physical crude market. Compared to the previous year, the ORB was up 56.8%, from $39.65/b in 2020, to an average of $62.16/b so far this year. All ORB components’ values increased over last month alongside their respective crude oil benchmarks. West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend, and Zafiro – rose $3.93 m-o-m in May, or 6.2% on average, to $66.79/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy, and Kuwait Export – increased by $3.66 m-o-m, or 5.7% on average, to settle at $67.24/b. Murban crude rose by $3.47 m-o-m, or 5.5% on average, to settle at $66.82/b, while the Merey crude component rose by $2.97 m-o-m, or 6.4% on average, to settle at 49.13/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices resumed the upward trend in May after their stall in April, and recorded six months of gains in the last seven months, increasing by 65% on a monthly basis between October 2020 and May 2021. Oil prices rose in May as market participants turned more optimistic about a further recovery in oil demand and accelerating global oil market rebalancing and oil destocking, which overshadowed the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in several Asian countries in May, specifically India and to a lesser extent Japan. The decision of OPEC and non-OPEC producers in the DoC to gradually adjust their production from May to July has consolidated market confidence. ICE Brent's first months rose 4.6% m-o-m in May on monthly average, to reach its highest level since May 2019, while NYMEX WTI rose by 5.6%, m-o-m, to hit its highest since October 2018. During the first half of May, futures prices were supported by increasingly positive market sentiment about economic recovery in the US and Europe, which was bolstered by robust economic data, particularly from the US, in addition to growing signs of strengthening oil demand led by the US and China, as well as western Europe. Oil prices also remained buoyed by a sharp drop in US crude oil stocks in the week to 30 April and a continuing recovery in refinery runs, while US exports surged by the highest level on record. Nonetheless, the oil prices rally was capped by the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in some Asian countries, including India, and rising infections in other countries, which weighed on market sentiment and raises uncertainty about the oil demand recovery in these regions. A cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline also added support to oil prices.

Sources: CME, DME, ICE and OPEC. In the third week of May, however, oil prices showed higher volatility after investors turned the focus on the deepening COVID-19 crisis in India and the colonial pipeline resumed operations, in addition to inflation concerns that added downward pressure on oil prices. The positive sentiment was offset by signs of an economic recovery in the US and Europe, and upbeat forecasts for oil demand in 2H21, with both OPEC and the IEA showing positive oil demand outlooks in their monthly reports last month. However, oil prices resumed an upward trend in the fourth week and reached their highest levels in more than two years on daily basis, buoyed by growing optimism about the consolidation of the oil demand recovery. More major European countries were relaxing travel restrictions, while mobility data in the US showed continuing recovery in the road and air transportation. The optimism on oil demand outlooks fuelled by a series of strong US economic data that continued to highlight the oil demand recovery in the largest oil consumer, in addition to signs of continuing improving oil demand recovery in Europe in the approach of the summer holidays season. Furthermore, the positive COVID-19 vaccination trends in the US and European Union, a decline in COVID-19 infections in India, weaker US dollar, and a rally in US equities added support to the market. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements The ICE Brent front month increase by $2.98 m-o-m, or 4.6%, in May to average $68.31/b, and NYMEX WTI rose by $3.45 m-o-m, or 5.6%, to average $65.16/b. ICE Brent was $21.14 higher y-t-d, or 49.9%, at $63.52/b, while NYMEX WTI was $23.75 higher, or 65.1%, at $60.25/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in May by $3.17 m-o-m, or 5.0%, to settle at $66.44/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $20.29 m-o-m, or 48.4%, at $62.18/b. On 9 June, ICE Brent stood at $72.22/b and NYMEX WTI at $69.96/b. The spread between ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI narrowed by 47¢ m-o-m in May to $3.15/b, its lowest level since December 2020, as the NYMEX WTI benchmark performed better than ICE Brent. The continuing recovery of US refinery operations, declining US crude stocks in May, the outage of the Colonial pipeline system that transports more than 2.5 million b/d of oil products, and strong US economic data have firmly supported the value of US futures crude benchmark. In the meantime, the spread of COVID-19 infections in Asia, particularly in India and Japan, has weighed on sentiment and slowed the rise of ICE Brent value compared to NYMEX WTI. However, the North Sea Dated premium to WTI Houston widened in May by 76¢ m-o-m, to average $2.61/b, as a result of firm North Sea crude values that continued to be supported in May by significant low production. However, in the USGC, the US crude exports remained volatile and low at around 2.8 mb/d in May, according to EIA weekly data. Despite higher futures oil prices in May, hedge funds and other money managers reduced their futures and options net-long positions in crude by 7.8% and were net sellers of about 53 mb between the week of 27 April and 25 May. The decline in net long positions was mainly in the ICE Brent contract that saw a decline of 15.3%. Money managers continued to show some cautiousness regarding their positioning in ICE Brent as surging COVID-19 infections in some Asian countries, specifically in India, raised concerns about the pace of oil demand recovery and weighed on investor confidence. Furthermore, the rise of oil prices to multi-month highs probably prompted some speculators to take some profits. However, in NYMEX WTI, speculators kept related futures and options net-long positions little changed, declining by only 1.7%, as strong US economic data and prospect of a rebound of US oil demand in the summer driving season kept money manager more optimistic about NYMEX WTI oil price outlook.

Speculators were net sellers of about 47 mb in Brent, and combined futures and options net long positions related to Brent fell by 46,647 contracts, or 15.3% lower, to reach 258,452 lots in the week to 25 May, its lowest level since early December 2020, according to the ICE Exchange. This is mainly due to the rise in short positions. In the week ending 25 May, gross short positions rose by 17,770 lots, or 20.5%, to 104,275 contracts, its highest level since early November 2020. Gross long positions fell by 28,877 lots, or 7.4% lower, to 362,727 contracts during the same period. Hedge funds and other money managers also cut their positions related to NYMEX WTI in May but at a slower rate. Combined futures and options net long positions in NYMEX WTI decreased by 6,423 contracts, or 1.7%, to 365,855 lots in the week to 25 May. This was due to a rise in short positions by 1,063 lots, or 2.5%, to 44,385 contracts, and long positions fell by 5,360 contracts, or 1.3%, to 410,240 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements The futures market structure The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in sustained backwardation in May as oil markets continue to tighten and investors were optimistic about further oil demand recovery in the summer holidays season, including in the US and Europe, and some positive preliminary data showing higher oil demand as well as rising road traffic indexes in almost all regions. The prospect of a restrained global oil supply growth and gradual adjustment of crude production from the DoC also contributed to maintaining the market in steep backwardation. However, compared to April, the ICE Brent forward curve eased slightly in the front. The backwardation in Brent remained firm in May but eased compared to the previous month as worries about the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in India and other Asian countries along with reinstating mobility restriction and local lockdown raised concerns about near term oil demand and weighed more on near-month prices compared to forwards. Traders were re-evaluating the near-term supply/demand outlook. The ICE Brent M1/M3 backwardation narrowed to its lowest since last March on a daily basis, suggesting that the market perception of the global supply/demand outlook deteriorated. On a monthly average, the ICE Brent M1-M3 spread narrowed by 24¢, from a backwardation of 91¢/b in April, to a backwardation of 66¢/b in May. The ICE Brent’s first to the sixth month also narrowed in May by 14¢ to $1.97 backwardation.

The return of firm buying interest from Chinese refiners and a wide Brent/Dubai spread that make Atlantic Basin crude shipments to AsiaPacific less favorable, as well as the expectation of a gradual increase of sour crude from Middle East producers, which kept DME Oman forward curve in backwardation. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 spread narrowed marginally by 4¢ to a backwardation of 96¢/b in May, from a backwardation of $1.00/b in April. However, in the US, the backwardation structure of NYMEX WTI strengthened over last month and the forward curve steepened on the front on the prospect of tightening supply/demand fundamentals in the US oil market amid expectation of rising demand for transportation fuels in the summer holiday season. US road and air traffic data showed gradual recovery amid easing COVID-19 mobility measure. The NYMEX WTI forward curve strengthened on declining US crude stocks in May including in Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub. US crude oil stocks fell by 19 mb between the week of 28 May and the week of 2 April, according to the EIA weekly data. Furthermore, the US utilization of refinery continued to recover over last month to reach 88.7% of total operable capacity in the week to 28 May, its highest level since Mid-February 2020. The NYMEX WTI first-to-third month spread widened by 19¢ to a backwardation of 36¢/b on average in May, compared to a backwardation of 18¢/b one month earlier Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread narrowed in May on a monthly average by 50¢ to a backwardation of 43¢/b, compared to 92¢/b in April. Nonetheless, in the US, the WTI M1/M3 backwardation widened in May by 20¢ to 34¢/b, compared to a backwardation of 14¢/b in April. The Dubai M1/M3 backwardation also widened on average in May by 11¢ to a backwardation of $1.17/b. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Crude spreads The sweet/sour crude differential widened in Asia and the USGC in May on better performance of light sweet crudes compared to heavier, while in Europe, the spread narrowed although it remained wide. The better performance of light distillate products, specifically gasoline, compared to heavier distillates like fuel oil, contributed in widening the sweet/sour crude differential. In Europe, the value of sour crude Urals rose more Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC than most light sweet crude in northwest Europe, US$/b resulting in a narrowing spread between the Urals and 5 the North Sea Dated, although it remained wide. Urals 4 crude value improved slightly in May on firm demand 3 from European and Asian refiners, specifically from 2 China amid favorable arbitrage economics. The 1 spread between North Sea Dated and Urals narrowed 0 in May by 19¢ to an average of $1.25/b, compared to -1 a spread of $1.44/b in April. Urals crude differential in northwest Europe and the Mediterranean also Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 recovered deep discounts. Tapis-Dubai On a monthly average, Urals crude differentials in North Sea Dated-Urals northwest Europe rose 60¢ to stand at a discount of LLS-Mars $1.93/b to North Sea Dated. Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. In Asia, the Tapis premium over Dubai increased further last month on improving the light sweet crude value as domestic light sweet crudes continued to be more attractive due to a wide Brent-Dubai EFS spread, which remained above $3/b in May on average, discouraging the flow of west-east arbitrage for Atlantic-Basin crudes. Firm demand for the Middle East sour crude from the Asia Pacific on the prospect of rising demand in coming months as well as a gradual increase of sour crude supply kept sour crude values firm. The Tapis-Dubai spread widened by 27¢ m-o-m in May, to average $3.01/b. In the USGC, the Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) premium over medium sour Mars widened in May by 27¢/b m-o-m, to $2.03/b. Light sweet crude value was supported by strengthening light distillate margins like gasoline, increasing US refinery intakes, the continuing decline in US crude oil stocks in US Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts 3 (PADD 3), as well as healthy demand of light sweet crude from European refiners. In the meantime, Mars sour crude value was under pressure from lower fuel oil margins in the USGC and higher sour supplies of sour crude from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodities prices rose strongly in May with across the board increases in crude oil, coal and natural gas. Coal prices increased steadily over the month on the back of warmer than average weather in North East Asia, as well as supply disruptions. Natural gas prices were supported, as in April, by lower than average temperatures in Europe, which delayed inventory replenishment, while in the US the expectation of higher demand due to warmer than average temperatures also supported prices. Crude oil prices rose on increased optimism of demand recovery and market rebalancing. Base metals rose to their highest since 2011, supported by global manufacturing expansion, a further easing in the US dollar value and some concerns about supply disruption. Gold prices jumped, erasing this year’s losses, as real interest rates in US dollar declined. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index rose m-o-m by 7.1% in May, with increases in crude oil, coal and natural gas. The average index level is up by 57% in the period January-May 2021, compared with the same five months in 2020. The very low prices experienced in 2Q20 contribute heavily to the y-o-y comparisons. The non-energy index rose by 6.8% m-o-m, with base metals rising by 7.5% and agriculture commodities up by 5.7%. The non-energy index was up by 35% in the January-May 2021 period, compared to the same period of 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In May, the Henry Hub natural gas price rose m-o-m to $2.9/mmbtu. Prices were up and down for the most of the month due to changing weather patterns across regions, however, the expectation of warmer than average weather towards the end of the month supported higher prices. According to the US Energy Information Administration, utilities added 98 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 28 May 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 2.313 bcf, around 2.6% below the latest five-year average. At the end of April, stocks were 3.0% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe rose strongly in May with the average Title Transfer Facility price up by around 25% m-o-m at $8.9/mmbtu. The trend of lower than average temperatures persisted for most of the month, which supported prices. At the same time, EU carbon emission prices surpassed $60/MT, which favours natural gas usage versus coal. EU inventories ended May around 38% full, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Inventories were approximately 73% full at the end of May last year. Higher natural gas demand in North East Asia has also supported LNG hub-based prices, which favours exports to that region. Australian thermal coal prices rose m-o-m by 16.1% in May to $107.0/mt. In the January-May 2021 timeframe, prices were around 48.5% higher than the same period last year. Prices strengthened due to warmer than average weather in Northeast Asia, and strong industrial activities, which have spurred higher thermal power demand. Back in April, thermal power generation in China was 12.5% higher y-o-y, while coal output declined by 1.8% y-o-y, according to official data. Higher prices for competing fuel natural gas has also supported coal prices in North East Asia.

The base metal price index rose m-o-m by 7.5% in May supported by the continuing expansion in global manufacturing activity, a lower US dollar value and concerns of supply disruption for selected metals. Average monthly copper prices rose m-o-m in May by 9.0% to average $10,161/Mt, which is a record high. Average prices in the January-May 2021 period were 65% higher than in the same period of 2020. As in April, concerns about lower output from South America and strong manufacturing activities supported prices. In addition, stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) declined to 122,425 tonnes at the end of May from 143,725 tonnes in April. However, International Copper Study Group (ICGS) estimations for the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the first two months of 2021 showed a surplus of 140,000 tonnes, suggesting a less tight market at the beginning of the year. Iron ore prices rose m-o-m in May by 15.5% to a monthly average of $207.7/mt, a record high. Average prices in the January-May 2021 period were 97% higher compared with the same period last year. Steel making activity rose at a global level by 23.3% in April 2021 compared to the same month last year. Chinese iron ore imports declined by 8.9% in May, but they remain up by 6.0% in the January-May 2021 period compared to the same months last year. In the group of precious metals, gold advanced by 5.1% m-o-m in May with further declines in real interest rates in US dollars, reversing the 1Q21 losses. Financial investors further increased their positions for the second month. Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ position across net length increased in natural gas, copper and gold during the month. In general, investors continue to show an optimistic view in commodities going forward.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 9 World Economy World Economy The recovery in the global economy continues. The positive dynamic in the US seems to have gained further pace in 2Q21, while the Euro-zone and Japan have remained impacted by lockdown measures during this period. With the exception of China, the pandemic has continued to impact growth in emerging and developing economies, especially India. With these counterbalancing forces, the 2021 global economic growth forecast remains unchanged at 5.5%. The growth estimate for 2020 was revised up slightly, due to better-than-expected 4Q20 output numbers in the OECD, and now stands at -3.4%, compared to -3.5% in the previous month. The underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 are unchanged. This includes the assumption that by the beginning of 2H21, COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for major emerging economies by then. In addition, forced private household savings during the lockdowns are forecast to accelerate global economic growth in 2H21 via pent-up demand, especially in the contact-intensive sectors. This dynamic has already started to materialise in major OECD economies, confirming this assumption. There are still some significant uncertainties. The path of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the overarching factor impacting the near-term pace of the recovery, with the potential emergence of new COVID-19 variants and/or mutations posing a particular risk. Moreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates could cause severe fiscal strain. While key interest-rates are still low and are assumed to stay at a very accommodative level in the near-term, inflation scares have come to the forefront very recently, fuelling a debate if the low interest rate environment will have to end soon. It is still too early to conclusively define if the rising inflation, with a special focus on US developments, is indeed temporary. However, the subject warrants close monitoring. The OECD growth estimate for 2020 was revised up to -4.7%, from -4.8%. OECD growth for 2021 remains at 4.8%, with counterbalancing effects from an accelerating US economy, while the Euro-zone and Japan are facing a delayed recovery due to ongoing lockdowns. In the emerging economies, India’s growth forecast for 2021 was revised down to 9.5% from 9.7%, taking into consideration further negative impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 challenges in the country. India’s 2020 GDP growth stood at -7.0%. Following growth of 2.3% in 2020, China’s GDP forecast was revised up to 8.5% in 2021 from 8.4% in the previous report. Brazil’s forecast for 2021 remains at 3.0%, following a contraction of 4.1% in 2020. Russia’s growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 3.0%, after contracting by 3.1% in 2020.

The US has continued to drive the rebound in western economies, while the Euro-zone and Japan have continued to remain negatively impacted by lock-down measures that were extended into 2Q21. Within the emerging and developing economies the pandemic remains as well at the forefront and with only China having widely contained the pandemic. In India the latest wave has very likely pushed GDP growth in 2Q21 into the negative despite the major stimulus efforts that were undertaken by the government. Russia and Brazil are both still being challenged by COVID-19, but have already started to benefit from the recovery in global trade and the rise in commodities demand, as well 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Economy as their improving price environment. With some further easing of lock-down measures across the world, a gradual shift from manufacturing and non-contact intensive services to contact-intensive services areas is materialising. This applies primarily to the sectors of travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure. This has led to a pick-up in activity in the Euro-zone, with many countries being deeply invested in the tourism sector. Also selective Asian economies benefitted from this re-emerging activity in travel and tourism, further supported by the rebound in China. Inflation was a prominent subject that was discussed very recently. US inflation rose significantly in almost all important measures. US total inflation stood at more than 4% in April and while Euro-zone inflation has shot up considerably, it stood at a much lower level, around 2%, in May. This has raised concern that central banks may be pressured to raise interest rates from the current relatively low or in some cases even negative level. It is still too early to conclusively define if the rising inflation in especially the US is transitory or if there is a sustained momentum towards unhealthy and higher inflation. When disaggregating the reasons for the recent jump in US inflation it is obvious that the base effect from last year’s pandemic pushes up inflation on a yearly comparison, which is the most watched measure. US CPI inflation in April stood at 4.15% y-o-y, but last year’s April and May inflation index levels declined due to the pandemic. Moreover, the strong annual rise in energy and food prices drove April inflation too. By excluding these two volatile components inflation would have stood at 2.96% y-o-y. Additionally, reopening effects and temporary supply shortages are driving the current inflation level and it remains to be seen if this is a continued trend. As a consequence of the pandemic, semi-conductors doubled prices over the last year and led to supply shortages in industrial production, leading to rising prices in a variety of goods. Finally, it remains to be seen how the ongoing US labour supply shortages will develop. Due to the extension of unemployment payments, childcare necessities during the still ongoing pandemic and the fear of retuning back to the office amid infection risks, the US labour participation rate has decline from more than 63% pre-pandemic to only 61.7% in April. If that continues, wages and earnings could see a sustained lift, with a real scare to rising and unhealthy inflation. However, taken positively it could also be argued that there is still significant slack in the global labour market and that therefore inflation pressure may ease in the near term. Moreover, peak-recovery growth may be seen in either 2Q21 or 3Q21 so the pricing pressures fuelled by the reopening effects may also abate towards the end of the year. Global trade has continued its considerable rebound Graph 3 1: Global trade This is thanks to the base effects from the large % change y-o-y declines in the last year, but also due to the ongoing 15 dynamic in global economic activity.

Near-term expectations The global near-term expectations have only changed marginally, reflecting selective adjustments in the OECD with an ongoing acceleration in the US, while the Euro-zone and Japan had continued difficulties amid ongoing lockdowns. This kept the OECD growth forecast unchanged at 4.8%. In the emerging and developing economies growth forecast are also almost unchanged. Importantly India was revised down slightly from 9.7% to 9.5%, amid the ongoing COVID-19 related challenges. The underlying assumption for the rest of 2021 is that by the beginning of 2H21, COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for major emerging economies by then. While growth in 1Q21 will still be particularly hit by the pandemic across the world, the recovery in OECD Americas, particularly in the US by 2Q21, is estimated to have gradually lifted the momentum. However, the Euro-zone, Japan, Latin American economies and, importantly, India will still be impacted by COVID-19 to a larger extent in 2Q21. With these base-assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is forecast to stand at 0.4% q-o-q and to accelerate to a level of 1.4% q-o-q in 2Q21. The major acceleration is then forecast to materialize in the 2H21 with 3Q21 growth forecast at 2.6% q-o-q and 4Q21 growth at 1.9% q-o-q. While the progress in industrial output is forecast to continue in 2H21, the recovery in 2H21 will be significantly supported by a rebound in contactOPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 11 World Economy intensive sectors, especially travel and tourism, as well as leisure and hospitality. Importantly, it is assumed that inflation will stay at reasonable levels so that central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates unexpectedly.

Also inflationary developments will need to be followed as the danger of rising interest rates, especially in the US, and consequent repercussions for the global economy would potentially derail the ongoing strong recovery. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments The growth dynamic in the US remains fuelled by a combination of the successful vaccination roll-out, pentup demand and the ongoing considerable stimulus measures that are key to finance the rebound. 1Q21 GDP growth was confirmed at 6.4% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR). The net personal savings rate as a percentage of net disposable personal income is pointing at a continued spending ability, standing at 14.9% in April, a decline from 27.6% in March, but comparing to averages of past years of around 7%. Continuing consumer spending is also supported by a rise in consumer confidence, which kept a supportive level in May, when it stood at 117.2, almost unchanged from 117.5 in April, based on the index provided by the Conference Board. While the government aims at further stimulus measures, the Fed has also continued its strong support, expanding its balance sheet by $326 billion in 1Q21, pointing to a continuation of its accommodative monetary policy. However, recently the topic of overheating and inflation in the US economy was widely discussed as the possibility of rising interest rates to avoid overheating the economy could dampen the ongoing growth path. In the meantime, important lead-indicators are pointing to a continued improvement into 2Q21. US CPI inflation stood at 4.2% y-o-y in April. However, among other COVID-19 related inflation effects, the base from 2020 is greatly distorted by the effects of the pandemic-induced lockdowns back then. Last year’s April and May inflation index levels declined due to the pandemic. Moreover, the strong annual rise in energy and food prices 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Economy drove April inflation too. By excluding these two volatile components inflation would have stood at 3% y-o-y. Importantly, reopening effects and temporary supply shortages are driving the current inflation level and it remains to be seen if this is a continued trend. In this regard, it remains to be seen, how the ongoing US labour supply shortages will develop. Due to the extension of unemployment payments, childcare necessities during the still ongoing pandemic and the fear of retuning back to the office amid infection risks the US participation rate has declined from more than 63% pre-pandemic to only 61.6% in May. If that continues, wages and earnings could see a sustained lift, with a real scare to rising and unhealthy inflation. However, taking this positively it could also be argued that there is still significant slack in the US labour market and that therefore inflation pressures may ease in the near term. Moreover, peak-recovery growth may be seen in 2Q21 in the US, so the pricing pressures fuelled by the reopening effects may also abate towards the end of the year. The labour market gained partial strength again in Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market May with the unemployment rate falling to 5.8%, % % compared to 6.1% in April. Non-farm payroll additions 62 16 increased by 559.000 in May, compared with 61.6 12 upwardly revised additions of 278.000 for April. 61 However, employers have continuously pointed at the 8 challenges to recruit. 60 5.8 4 59 0 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Particpation rate (LHS) Unemploment rate (RHS) Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations After 1Q21, GDP growth of 6.4% q-o-q SAAR, 2Q21, growth is forecast to accelerate to 9.0% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21. Growth in 3Q21 is forecast to reach 6.8% q-o-q SAAR, and then slow down to 2.8% q-o-q SAAR in 4Q21. With this slow-down towards the end of the year, the current inflationary pressures should taper off to some extent. Growth in 2H21 is forecast to remain supported by ongoing consumer spending and investment. A significant lift in growth will come from the contact-intensive service sectors, which has already seen a strong rebound in 2Q21. Findings from the Secretariat show that the latest 1.9 trillion USD fiscal stimulus plan, the American Rescue Plan, supports GDP growth up to around 7.5 pp for 2021. The effectiveness of these and other stimulus measures will determine how much at the end US GDP growth will be supported, but with additional fiscal measures that may be implemented by the US administration alter in the year US GDP growth could reach 7% or higher in 2021. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, remain. An important concern is that inflation will rise at such a pace that market rates will carry an unexpected dynamic, impairing the ongoing recovery. The economy’s recovery continues to be reflected in Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and May’s PMI levels as provided by the Institute for non-manufacturing indices Supply Management (ISM), indicating an ongoing Index pickup in the coming months with a sector rotations 70 from manufacturing to the services sector.

Growth in 2020 stood at -3.5%. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments While the Euro-zone has been impacted by continuous lock-down measures in 1H21, the easing of these restrictions amid the successful vaccination rollout and the consequent decline in COVID-19 infections have led to the expected pickup in economic activity towards the end of 2Q21. The vaccination drive is accelerating further and expected to reach more than 50% in the summer time. The rebound, particularly in the contactintensive services sector and global trade are supporting the momentum. In the meantime, growth in 2H20 was revised up slightly by the Euro-zone’s statistical office, so that full-year 2020 GDP growth now stands at -6.7%, compared to -6.8% in the previous month. 1Q21 GDP growth was reported at -0.6% q-o-q seasonally adjusted (SA), translating into a 1Q21 yearly decline of -1.8%. The European Central Bank (ECB), has continued its accommodative monetary policies, but will need to carefully monitor price developments as inflation rose to 2% in May. But as in other western economies, it remains to be seen if the rise in inflation is a temporary phenomenon or if it is a dynamic that will continue. In addition to inflation concerns, growth in lending to the private sector, an important lifeline of liquidity in the Euro-zone, has slowed down over the last months, although remaining at a strong level. Lending to the private sector by monetary financial institutions stood at 2.6% y-o-y in April, after 3.2% y-o-y in March and 3.8% y-o-y in both January and February. However, with the rising activity in Euro-zone economies, lending is forecast to pick up again, also supported by an accelerated pace of the ECB’s bond buying programme for three months, as announced in March. Supported by the ongoing social welfare measures in Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales the Euro-zone and the now accelerating pace of the % change y-o-y recovery, the labour market has continued 30 improving. The latest available April numbers from 25.0 Eurostat point to an improving situation, as the 20 unemployment rate stood at 8% in April, after 8.1% in March and 8.2% both February and January. 10 The rise in retail sales growth reached a very high 0 level, given the low base from 2020, rising by 25% -10 y-o-y in April, after 14% in March, both on a seasonally adjusted base. This translates into a monthly decline -20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 of 3.2% in April, after a rise of 3.7% in March. Similarly Industrial production (IP) rose considerably on a yearly base, rising by 10.7% y-o-y in March, following Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities a decline of 1.6% y-o-y in February. and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations The momentum in the Euro-zone seems to have gained pace towards the end of 2Q21 and is forecast to accelerate further into 3Q21. This will be significantly lifted by the rising activity in the contact-intensive services sector, mainly in travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure. Furthermore the government-led stimulus is also providing a sound financial base for the recovery. In addition, the momentum in the Euro-zone’s major trading partners, the US and China, has gained considerable pace, leading to rising trade activity with the Eurozone. 1Q21 GDP growth was reported at -2.5% q-o-q SAAR, affected by lockdowns and other COVID-19-related 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Economy social-distancing measures. By 2Q21, growth is forecast to accelerate to 4.5% q-o-q SAAR. The main pick-up on a quarterly level is then forecast to materialize in 3Q21, when domestic consumption, investments and a rise in exports are all forecast to lift GDP growth to 10.8% q-o-q SAAR. 4Q21 is still expected to be strong and reach 5.7% q-o-q SAAR. The recovery is thus forecast to be delayed when compared to the US and China, which both have a more frontloaded recovery. This, in turn, may also fuel foreign direct investments into the Euro-zone in 2H21 and support the euro, but this will also depend on interest rate developments in the US. The May PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed to Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs an ongoing improving situation in the manufacturing Index and services sectors. Momentum in the services 70 63.1 sector is forecast to gain significant pace in the 60 coming months. The manufacturing PMI rose to 63.1, 55.2 after 62.9 in April and 62.5 in March. The PMI for 50 services, the largest sector in the Euro-zone, rose to 40 55.2 in May, after 50.5 in April. These rising levels in the services sector compare to 49.6 in March and 45.7 30 in February. 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit and Haver Analytics.

This comes after an upwardly revised GDP decline of 6.7% for 2020, compared to the previous estimate of the Euro-zone’s statistical office, which stood at -6.8%. OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Japan’s economy remains impacted by lockdown measures during most of 1H21. Hence the domestic activity is estimated to have been muted in most of the year so far, particularly in the services sector. In the meantime industrial production has performed well as this has been very much supported by external trade. The vaccination drive has progressed as it is becoming more imminent for the government, especially with the Summer-Olympics in Tokyo getting closer. The government is now aiming at getting the part of the population older than 65 vaccinated by summer. This accounts for around a third of the population. In the meantime 2020 GDP growth has been revised up for 2H20 to higher growth rates by the statistical office. The decline in GDP for the calendar year of 2020 now stands at -4.7%, compared to the previous estimate of -4.9%. However, growth in 1Q21 was reported at -5.1% q-o-q SAAR as it has been significantly impacted by lockdown measures. While 2Q21 seems to show positive growth, the level seems to be still very low as it is impacted by the extended lockdown measures. In the meantime, consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved, confirming a better pace, despite the re-emerging lockdown measures. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 15 World Economy Growth in industrial production (IP) was significantly positive in April, rising by 14.1% y-o-y, but very much driven by last year’s base effect, given a significant pandemic related decline in April last year. Positively, also on a monthly base the rise was considerable due to underlying improvements in exports, benefitting from rising global trade and mobility. Consequently, the monthly rise of IP stood at 2.4% m-o-m in April. Growth in exports recovered strongly as well, rising Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports by 38% y-o-y in April, after 16.1% y-o-y in March on a % change y-o-y non-seasonally adjusted base, following a decline of 50 4.5% y-o-y in February.

Near-term expectations Japan is forecast being able to participate in the global recovery in both external and domestic trade with its vaccination roll-out estimated to make progress, as this will also be an important factor for hosting the summer Olympics. After the 1Q21 GDP decline of 5.1% q-o-q SAAR, it is assumed that the virus will be widely contained in Japan towards the end of 2Q21 and a strong rebound is expected to materialise by 2H21. Given that the level of stringency of the lockdown has been increased compared to previous ones, it is likely to drag growth by around 1 percentage points in 2Q21. Growth in 2Q21 is forecast to rise by 0.8% q-o-q SAAR. This is lower than in the last month’s forecast, when quarterly growth forecast stood at 2% q-o-q SAAR. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 then should pick up with the global economy’s recovery gaining pace and also domestic demand in Japan is expected to rise further. Hence, growth is forecast at 9% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21, before slowing somewhat to reach 5.5% in 4Q21. The impact form the ongoing lockdown is also Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs reflected in the latest PMIs from May with both the Index manufacturing and the services sector decelerating. 60 The manufacturing PMI retracted to 53, compared 53.0 with 53.6 in April and 52.7 in March.

However, Chinese economic recovery momentum started to signal a marginally slower growth which recently magnified by the 2020 low base of comparison that boosted a noticeable y-o-y growth of key activity indicators in April. Domestic demand continued its weak recovery, indeed according to National Bureau of Statistics of China data, consumer confidence fell in April to 121.50 points from 122.20 points in March and retail sales rose only by 0.3% m-o-m in April 2021. On a y-o-y base, retail trade grew by 17.7% y-o-y in April following a 34.2% y-o-y jump in the March. On external demand, China’s trade continued its out-performance amid strengthening yuan, a further recovery global demand and higher commodity prices. The most recent official data indicated that the value of goods exports surged by 27.9% y-o-y in US dollar terms in May, compared with a 32.3% jump in April. Imports recorded the sharpest increase in a decade, amid the surging international commodity prices and an appreciating renminbi. China's trade surplus stood at $45.5 billion in May 2021 compared with a surplus of $61.9 billion in May 2020, exports jumped 27.9% while imports soared at a faster 51.1%. The country's trade surplus with the US surged to $31.78 billion in May from $28.11 billion in April. Considering the first five months of the year, China trade surplus surged sharply to $203.45 billion, from $119.54 billion over the same period of 2020. Exports jumped 40.2% y-o-y to $1.24 trillion, while imports surged 35.6% to $1.03 trillion. On the policy front, China’s government launched a series of promotional activities to boost domestic consumption, one of which was a month long shopping campaign during the month of May. Simultaneously, online shopping platforms would offer sales on food, travel, and cultural and sporting products for half a month. In March 2021, the government also extended the financial relief measures for small and micro businesses that were in place from 2018 until 2020. The plan encourages the local governments to lower loan guarantee costs by about 1.5% or below for these businesses. Overall, China has augmented fiscal deficit that includes off-budget spending, increased in 2020 to 13.2% of GDP from 11.2% in 2019.

Near-term expectations China macroeconomic monthly and 1Q21 indicators recorded substantial recovery on a y-t-y base, but on a m-o-m base, signs of a slower growth pace are obvious. Consumption growth still lags slightly behind which might represent a downside risk for the recovery. A robust consumption growth is a key tool for the policymakers to normalize macroeconomic conditions. In the interim, the PMI indices reflect the sustained manufacturing and services sector recovery as well as the bounce back from the temporary fall amid the New Year holiday restrictions.

For the time being, India’s COVID-19 curve may begin to plateau as the state led lockdown strategy helped in reducing the daily COVID-19 cases, as well as keeping the effective reproduction rate below 1. Nevertheless, the daily vaccination rate has dropped to just around one million which might slow down the exit plans. Indeed, the monthly macroeconomic indicators suggested the current COVID-19 restrictions have weighed on economic activities.

Near-term expectations The recent GDP official data suggested that the economy advanced faster than expected before the resurgent COVID infections introduced the new wave of challenges. India’s current situation combined with the slowing vaccination rate might lead to a contraction in 2Q21 amid the introduction of restriction measures that might extended to 3Q21. The economy is forecast to resume its recovery in 2H21 under the assumption of the virus being under control through boosted vaccination rates alongside herd immunity.

Across country lockdowns re-introduced and the world famous Carnival festival was cancelled. Yet the recent official data suggested that Brazil’s real GDP advanced 1% y-o-y in 1Q21; following a contraction of 1.1% y-o-y in 4Q20, the recent growth is the first expansion since 4Q19. On the supply side, the expansion was driven by industry growth of 3% y-o-y versus 1.2% y-o-y in 4Q20. The agricultural sector also sharply rebounded growing by 5.2% y-o-y following a contraction of 0.4% y-o-y in 4Q20. The services sector also recovered as it contracted by 0.8% y-o-y in 1Q21 compared to a contraction of 2.2% y-o-y in 4Q20. On the demand side, there was a sharp expansion in fixed investment which grew by 17% y-o-y as well as exports that expanded 0.8% y-o-y. On a quarterly basis, the real GDP advanced 1.2% in 1Q21, following a 3.2% growth in 4Q20. Due to a low base year effect linked to the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis most of April’s macroeconomic indicators recorded a double – digit expansion. Retail sales grew at a record 23.8% y-o-y in April mainly base year effect linked to the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. However, on a monthly base the retail trade expanded 1.8% m-o-m in April reversing an upwardly revised 1.1% m-o-m contraction in March. Similarly, industrial production in Brazil expanded 34.7% y-o-y in April of 2021 while it retreated 1.3% m-o-m following a downwardly revised 2.2% contraction in March. The drop in the industrial activities reflected the recordbreaking daily deaths from COVID-19 and ongoing public-health restrictions. The unemployment rate surged 14.7% in 1Q21 from 13.9% in 4Q20, the number of unemployed persons went up by 880 thousand to an all-time high of 14.81 million while those employed shrank by 529 thousand to 85.90 million. The labour force participation rate was unchanged at 56.8% and the employment rate edged down by 0.5 pp to 48.4%. 20 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Economy The consumer price index surged to 6.76% y-o-y in Graph 3 16: Brazil’s inflation vs. interest rate April registering the sharpest increase since % change y-o-y % per annum November 2016.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 21 World Economy Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments South Africa's real GDP is recovering relatively slowly from the impact of restrictions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak but it is far below pre-pandemic level. According to Statistics South Africa, the economy grew on an annualized rate of 4.6% q-o-q in 1Q21, compared with the downwardly revised growth of 5.8% q-o-q in 4Q20. Nevertheless, according to the same source, the real GDP contracted 3.2% y-o-y in 1Q21; registering the fourth straight quarter of economic drop and means the economic output is still below the pre-pandemic levels. Several factor might have caused this drop including the imminent third wave of COVID-19 as well as the relatively slow vaccination rollout. Moreover, the electricity constraints and the weak pace of structural reforms might weigh on the recovery of the economy. In the meantime, the National Treasury and the central bank expect output to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. It is important to recall that South Africa’s economy has been under its longest downward cycle since World War II. The economy is facing a weak business sentiment that weighed on fixed investment spending, combined with risk averse private-sector which avoids investing large capital in domestic projects. As in most other economies inflationary pressures continued to increase as the consumer price index surged to 4.4% y-o-y in April, a 14-month high. Partially April’s inflation rate reflected the low price baseline in April 2020 when the country entered a strict COVID-19 lockdown. But apart from that, the high inflation in April also represents the overall rise in fuel and food prices, which is indeed a global trend in 1H21. Nevertheless, the current inflation rate is still below the midpoint of the 3-6% target range set by the South African Reserve Bank. As a result, the central bank might keep the policy rate at the current rate of 3.5%. Such a move is also supported by the appreciation of the rand, which averaged R14.4:US$1 in April . On the labour market end, South Africa's unemployment rate surged to 32.6% in 1Q21 from 32.5% in the 4Q20. This was the highest jobless rate since comparable data began in 2008. Total employment drop down specifically construction and trade sectors. Over the same comparison period, the expanded definition of unemployment, including people who have stopped looking for a work, rose to 43.2%, from 42.6%. In addition, the youth unemployment rate, measuring job seekers between 15 and 24 years old, recorded a record high of 63.3%. Near-term expectations The near-term outlook of South Africa’s economy is highly constrained by the vaccination rate and the speed of the vaccination rollout. The emergence of a new virus variation represents a real threat to the recovery in 2021. Despite the relaxation of some COVID-19 restrictions, business confidence according to the RMB/BER index fell to 35 in 1Q21 from 40 in 4Q20. Confidence decreased mostly in retail due to weaker-than-expected Black Friday and festive sales. By contrast, South Africa's Absa Manufacturing PMI South rose to 57.8 in May from 56.2 in April, reaching its highest level since October 2020. Similarly the forward looking FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index rose to -9 in 1Q21 from -12 in 4Q20, bringing confidence to levels not seen in a year, but the -9 reading is still well below the average of +2 recorded in 1994 Considering the improvement in the forward looking Table 3 9: South Africa’s economic growth rate indictors, 2021 Real GDP forecast was revised up and revision, 2020–2021*, % slightly to 3.3% from last month rate of 3.1%.

The less severe contraction was supported by the improvement in oil prices and the optimism over the global economic recovery. The main growth was registered in water supply and waste disposal growing 11.9% y-o-y. While the supply of electricity, gas and steam advanced 9.5% y-o-y. The transport sector contracted 34% amid the decline in the mobility rate in the 1Q21. A positive note was recorded in the labour market, as the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 5.2% in April, from 5.4% in March but the rate was still above prepandemic levels. Contrarily, inflationary pressure continued to provide a major concern, the consumer price index was 5.5% in April 2021, which marked a slight slowdown in the inflation rate, compared to 5.8% y-o-y in March. However, the inflation remains significantly high and above the 4% target rate set by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). It is important to note that these rates are compared to the low base period; when inflation slowed significantly in March 2020, as large parts of the domestic and global economy were forced to shut down due to the pandemic. Indeed, the low comparison base made it more difficult for the CBR and other statistical agencies to assess the cost of the average consumer basket as consumption changed rapidly and unexpectedly. Nevertheless, the inflation rate remains a concern to Graph 3 18: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate the CBR, which has raised interest rates by 75 basis % points since the start of 2021. Regardless of the 6 monetary tightening, the ongoing robust demand 5.5 recovery might prompt businesses to raise prices 5 5.0 further, specifically in the services sector.

OPEC Member Countries Saudi Arabia According to Saudi Arabia’s Central Department of Statistics and Information preliminary estimates, Saudi Arabia real GDP contracted 3.3 % y-o-y in 1Q21, recording the 7th consecutive quarter of contraction. Yet, the non-oil sector activities advanced 3.3% y-o-y amid the noticeable sector recovery from the pandemic. In May 2021, Saudi Arabia’s PMI increased to 56.4 from 55.2 in April, suggesting the highest recovery in the non-oil activities since January, amid an easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The near term future might carry a further economic recovery as the government’s comprehensive programme to develop the water sector involving the private sector which is creating a host of investment opportunities both through asset sales and public-private partnerships (PPPs). This also might attract more foreign direct investment. Overall, with the improvement in oil prices, the 2021 outlook is more solid and positive. Nigeria Nigeria real GDP advanced 0.5% y-o-y in 1Q21, following a 0.1% y-o-y in 4Q21. The country registered the second consecutive quarterly growth since Nigeria’s economy faced recession in 3Q20 amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and an improvement in oil prices. The non-oil sector expanded 0.8% y-o-y in 1Q21 following a 1.7% y-o-y growth in 4Q20. The current growth was powered by the agriculture sector, which expanded by 2.3% y-o-y. Industrial activity moved back into growth of 0.9% y-o-y, after dropping by 5.6% y-o-y on average in 2020. The forward looking PMI indices supported the ongoing recovery as the Stanbic IBTC Bank Nigeria PMI jumped to 54.4 in May 2021, from 52.9 in the previous period. This was the strongest improvement in the health of the private sector in 9 months. Moreover, the annual inflation rate declined to 18.12% in April 2021, from a four-year high of 18.17% in March but producer inflation accelerated to a significantly high level, amid raw material shortages and unfavourable exchange rate depreciation. Consequently, the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) decided to keep its policy rate at 11.5% at its recent meeting Looking forward, Nigeria’s business sentiment remained optimistic, driven by the current expansion in manufacturing operations as well as the higher oil prices. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Recent Federal Competitiveness and Statistics data suggested that the UAE economy contracted by 6.1% y-o-y in 2020. Meanwhile the IHS Markit UAE PMI declined to 52.3 in May 2021 from 52.7 in April. Despite the marginal drop, the current reading indicted the sixth straight month of growth in the non-oil private sector, amid the ongoing vaccination progress as well as the significant ease in COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Most importantly according to the PMI report, business sentiment hit its highest since July 2020. Looking forward, the better than expected recovery on a global level as well as the less tight travel restrictions might feed the continued recovery from COVID-19, supported additionally by the government’s large-scale projects, new visa rules and the delay of Expo 2020. 24 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Economy The impact of the US dollar (USD) and inflation on oil prices The US dollar (USD) generally weakened in May Graph 3 20: ORB crude oil price index compared amid decline interest rates expectations in USD.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 25 World Oil Demand World Oil Demand World oil demand is anticipated to have declined by 9.3 mb/d in 2020, some 0.1 mb/d higher than last month’s report, mainly to reflect updated data in both the OECD and non-OECD regions. Total global oil consumption for last year is expected to average 90.6 mb/d. For 2021, world oil demand growth was kept unchanged at around 6.0 mb/d with total oil demand at 96.6 mb/d. OECD demand was revised slightly lower, on an annualized basis, mainly to reflect lower-thanexpected data from OECD Americas and Europe in 1Q21. However, initial data for April in both regions and the positive developments in mobility due to easing COVID-19 restrictions, as well as the opening of borders encouraged upward revisions of 2Q21 data and offset most of the 1Q21 downward revisions. In the nonOECD, oil demand was revised marginally higher on annualized basis, offsetting all of the OECD downward revisions, mainly due to positive 2Q21 data from the Middle East. OECD oil demand is anticipated to increase by 2.7 mb/d in 2021 with most of the gains accruing in 2H21. OECD Americas, led by the US, is projected to be the largest contributor to oil demand growth in 2021, supported by rebounding transportation fuels, mainly gasoline, and healthy lightand middle-distillate requirements. However, 2021 oil demand in the region is not anticipated to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Non-OECD oil demand is estimated to rise by 3.3 mb/d in 2021 with growth largely focused in China, followed by India and Other Asia. A healthy rebound in economic momentum is expected to stimulate industrial fuel demand. Demand for petrochemical feedstocks is also projected to support growth in 2021.

OECD OECD Americas Update on the latest developments The latest monthly data from OECD Americas shows Graph 4 1: OECD Americas oil demand, y-o-y oil demand rising by 0.7 mb/d y-o-y in March 2021, change after decreasing by around 3.5 mb/d y-o-y in mb/d February. However, due to the low baseline in 2020, demand remained significantly lower than pre6 pandemic consumption levels and was lower by more 4 than 1.0 mb/d compared with March 2019. The y-o-y increases in March 2021 were mainly attributed to 2 gasoline rebounding from the March 2020 slump due 0 to the onset of COVID-19 and its impact on mobility -2 and transportation fuels. The US was the only country posting a y-o-y increase in March 2021, while -4 Canada, Mexico and Chile all showed declines of -6 around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, collectively.

The latest monthly data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows oil demand rising by 0.9 mb/d y-o-y in March 2021, after posting a decline of 2.4 mb/d y-o-y in February. Demand fell by nearly 1.0 mb/d compared with March 2019. However, noticeable developments were recorded in gasoline, diesel and fuel oil demand in light of easing COVID-19 restrictions in various states, leading to a m-o-m rise in vehicle miles travelled and improvements in industrial activity that supported growth for those fuels. Vehicle miles travelled rose nearly 19.0%,y-o-y, in March 2021, according to the Federal Highway Administration, following a decline of 12.1%,y-o-y, in February and a drop of 18.9%,y-o-y, in March 2020. Additionally, total auto sales posted strong y-o-y gains in March 2021, increasing by 58.7% y-o-y compared with a decline of 5.6% y-o-y in February and 34.6% y-o-y decline in March 2019. Diesel demand posted growth only for the second time since OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 27 World Oil Demand the beginning of 2019. March 2021 diesel data showed an increase of more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y after declining by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in February.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Near-term expectations Oil demand in OECD Americas will be largely directed by the US, particularly with regard to transportation fuels. With a successful vaccination campaign and the large fiscal stimulus that was endorsed in March, positive oil demand performance is expected over the short term. Traffic has stabilized at 94% on the US on the back of vaccination rollouts in many states that allowed mobility restrictions to be reduced and lifted in some states. The pace of this development is projected to have a positive impact on oil demand in 2Q21 and 2H21. Further support is projected to stem from the petrochemical sector, supported by strong end-user demand for plastic products. The US aviation sector remained at around 60% of 2019 levels in May with some improvement in domestic routes. Going forward, the sector is projected linger below 2019 levels and will show positive growth on annualized basis in 2021.

Oil demand posted hefty mb/d declines when compared to normal consumption and 4 was 1.6 mb/d below March 2019 with most of the declines attributed to the poor performance of the 2 middle part of the barrel, primarily transportation fuels. Most of the decline improvements in March 2021 was attributed to strong y-o-y naphtha demand, a 0 continuation of the healthy trend registered in recent months. Demand for petrochemical feedstocks was -2 supported by healthy naphtha cracking margins and strong appetite for the feedstock to fulfil increasing -4 end-user demand. 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* Note: * 2Q21-4Q21 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. Gasoline also posted y-o-y gains, increasing by nearly 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, compared to large decline in February of 0.4 mb/d y-o-y. Improvements in mobility across the region’s main economies supported gasoline demand coupled with historical declines in March 2020 gasoline consumption. The mobility index in March was higher m-o-m in a number of countries – such as in Germany, France, the UK and Spain – while mobility in Italy was lagging, according to Google and Apple mobility data. Additionally, based on initial figures from the Association des Constructeurs Européens d’Automobiles (ACEA), March 2021 new vehicle registrations in the EU increased by a massive 91.7%, y-o-y, compared with a decline of 19.3% y-o-y, in February. New passenger car registrations dropped by around 65.9% y-o-y, in March 2020. Increases in the industrial production index supported fuel oil and diesel demand, reducing the level of y-o-y decreases. Fuel oil was flat y-o-y for two consecutive months while diesel recorded a decline of 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in March, compared with a drop of 0.8 mb/d in February. Industrial production, which excludes construction, posted an increase of 10.7% y-o-y, compared to 1.1% drop in February, according to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and Haver Analytics. 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 4: Europe’s Big 4* oil demand, mb/d Change 2021/20 By product Mar 21 Mar 20 mb/d % LPG 0.40 0.44 -0.04 -9.0 Naphtha 0.61 0.49 0.12 23.7 Gasoline 0.98 0.96 0.02 2.2 Jet/kerosene 0.36 0.58 -0.22 -38.2 Diesel 3.04 3.13 -0.09 -3.0 Fuel oil 0.16 0.13 0.02 17.3 Other products 0.44 0.39 0.05 12.9 Total 5.97 6.12 -0.15 -2.4 Note: * Germany, France, Italy and the UK.

Near-term expectations Oil demand is projected to show healthy performance towards later part of 2Q21 following the easing of mobility and travel restrictions in many European countries in the second half of May. Gasoline, diesel and jet fuel are expected to pick up pace as travel and tourism activity gradually improves across the region. Some preliminary data indicates positive oil demand developments across Europe. UK fuel sales for the month of May, for example, reached the highest level since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to various sources. Furthermore, latest toll roads data in countries such as France, Italy and Spain recorded higher use and almost matched pre-pandemic levels. Portugal and the Netherlands opened up travel, and the UK allowed tourists to travel to certain destinations. The outlook for the region’s oil demand in 2021 is in line with last month’s projections, with some downward revisions in 1Q21, taking into consideration the most recent data. The acceleration of vaccination programmes and an easing of travel restrictions provide some upside potential to the forecast. On the other hand, unforeseen developments related to COVID-19 due to emergence of new variants could possibly tilt the outlook to the downside going forward.

M-o-m improvements in mobility supported gasoline requirements in almost all countries of the region. In Japan and South Korea, mobility improved from 92 and 78, respectively, in February to 108 and 83 in March, according to Google Maps and Apple mobility data using January 2020 as a reference. Diesel demand edged slightly higher in March after gaining around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in February. Industrial production in both Japan and South Korea rose y-o-y. In Japan, industrial production recorded a 0.9% y-o-y increase for the first time since January 2019, after declining by more than 3% in February as reported by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Haver Analytics.

Preliminary METI data for April 2021 shows Japanese oil demand increasing by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, marking the second consecutive monthly increase. Oil demand growth mainly recovered from the huge decline in April 2020 (-0.7 mb/d) and the slower-than-expected recovery in the transportation sector mainly due to increases in COVID-19 infection cases. Most of the petroleum product category requirements grew, notably gasoline, naphtha and diesel.

Sources: JODI, METI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Oil demand is projected to remain pressured by some challenges related to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, particularly in Japan. This has led to localized lockdown measures, which could especially hinder transportation fuel demand. On the other hand, the upcoming Summer Olympics could provide some upside potential to transportation fuel requirements and the robustness of the petrochemical sector could furthermore support light distillate demand. For the whole of 2021, oil demand is projected to increase for the first time since 2017 on the back of low demand registered in 2020, the improving petrochemical sector and the generally healthy economy. As with other regions globally, however, uncertainties are skewed to the downside in line with COVID-19 pandemic developments. In terms of products, jet fuel demand is not anticipated to reach pre-pandemic levels and will remain under pressure throughout the year. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments In April 2021, China’s oil demand increased by 1.6 mb/d y-o-y, after posting stronger gains in March, of more than 2.1 mb/d y-o-y. China’s demand is trending comfortably above March 2019 levels by more than 0.3 mb/d, making it the only country so far with consumption exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Oil demand remains focused on transportation fuels recovering strongly from the low base of consumption in 2020 and some support for LPG demand from the petrochemical sector. Diesel fuel demand also increased, though at a lower growth pace than previous months. Gasoline consumption followed a similar trend in the last two months, increasing by more than 0.6 mb/d. Both mobility and passenger car sales indexes are showing positive signs. Mobility reached 100 in April, according to the Google and Apple mobility indexes, up from 87 in March. While motor vehicle sales posted a 9.9% rise in April 2021 compared with an increase of 4.12% in April 2020, according to the China Association for Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) and Haver Analytics. In April 2021, sales of vehicles exceeded 2.4 million units for the first in 2021 and matched similar sales recorded in May 2018. 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Oil Demand Consumption of jet/kerosene grew strongly in April Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change 2021, rising by nearly 0.7 mb/d y-o-y, after increasing mb/d by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in March 2021.

Near-term expectations Positive macroeconomic indicators are expected to continue to be buoyed by a surge in exports and respectable improvement in manufacturing, which in turn will support oil demand going forward. Total consumption in the country has exceeded the 2019 average annual consumption level and is projected to gain further momentum in 2H21 with support from strong petrochemical capacity additions. The well-contained COVID-19 situation, the fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes and new capacity additions of PDH plants are assumed to encourage demand over the short term. On the other hand, rising trade tensions with the US pose some downside risks to the forecast. All sectors are expected to gain momentum with transportation being supported by road traffic and healthy passenger sales, while the industrial sector is projected to receive support from healthy economic activities in China and globally. Moreover, demand for light distillates for the petrochemical sector is projected to drive demand growth in the current year.

Near-term expectations Daily new COVID-19 cases increased in May, forcing states to implement lockdowns and other restrictions that led to steep decline in mobility. The decline in transportation fuel demand was already a factor in 2Q21 data and the recovery will be slower as compared to initial expectations. As COVID-19 cases come under control and restrictions are eased towards 3Q21, oil demand, led by transportation fuel, is projected to show solid gains throughout the reminder of year. That said, uncertainty will remain high mainly related to a possible new wave of COVID-19 or the emergence of new variants, in addition to the pace of vaccinations in the country. Moreover, high retail prices and the government excise tax policy add uncertainty going forward. Oil demand growth is anticipated to pick up pace in 2H21, driven by the low baseline and uptick in gasoline and diesel demand in transportation, construction and agriculture. 32 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Oil Demand Latin America Update on the latest developments With March 2021 oil demand data now complete, oil Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y demand in Latin America posted y-o-y increase of change more than 0.3 mb/d, compared with March 2020. mb/d February 2021 indicated a decline of more than 0.9 0.1 mb/d y-o-y and when comparing March 2021 oil 0.6 data with March 2019, demand fell by around 0.1 mb/d.

The latest available data for Brazil indicate an increase of more than 0.4 mb/d, y-o-y in April, as recovery in industrial fuels and tucking activity supported this increase. Transportation fuels, led by gasoline, also contributed to this rise. Reduction in Covid-19 cases in April drove the improvement in mobility in cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but increase in cases towards the end of the month may have affected May’s consumption.

Near-term expectations 2Q21 oil demand is projected to be pressured by rising COVID-19 cases in the region’s main economies. As a result, the pace of recovery – particularly for transportation fuels led by gasoline and jet fuel – will face challenges. Diesel and fuel oil demand are projected to improve towards the 2H21 in light of the positive economic outlook. Generally, 2H21 is anticipated to show positive demand development amid a recovering economy and low baseline of comparison in 2020. However, the considerable uncertainties will remain skewed to the downside, particularly due to issues related to COVID-19 cases, vaccination programmes and the possible emergence of new COVID-19 variants. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 33 World Oil Demand Middle East Update on the latest developments Middle East oil demand data for March 2021 show Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change a firm increase led by recovering demand for mb/d transportation and power generation fuels from 1.0 Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Data indicate growth of nearly 0.6 mb/d y-o-y, compared to a drop of more than 0.5 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in February. The historical decline in consumption during March 2020 remains a central 0.0 factor. However, as compared to March 2019, oil -0.5 demand still showed a decline of 0.4 mb/d. Gasoline, fuel oil and diesel posted increases and led oil -1.0 demand growth in March 2021. Gasoline increased by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, with steady gains in -1.5 Saudi Arabia and Iraq supported by increased mobility.

Fuel oil and diesel also posted gains y-o-y, growing by around 0.2 mb/d and 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, respectively, following y-o-y declines in the first two months of 2021. Increases mainly resulted from improvements in the industrial sector in various countries as well as an uptick in bunker fuel demand. Moreover, power generation in Saudi Arabia encouraged additional demand for fuel oil while fuel oil demand in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE also rose due to improved industrial and trading activity. In Saudi Arabia, the latest available data for April 2021 indicates a strong rebound in oil demand of more than 0.4 mb/d y-o-y, mostly credited to increases in gasoline demand. Gasoline consumption was higher by 0.2 mb/d y-o-y as COVID-19 measures were eased and led to improved mobility generally. Jet/kerosene also flipped into growth, adding marginal y-o-y volume on the back of improved domestic air traffic and slower demand during April 2020. Additionally, heavy distillates rose solidly, with fuel oil and crude oil for the use in power generation each increasing by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. Near-term expectations Oil demand is expected to gradually recover and post steady gains in 2H21. However, this will largely depend on COVID-19 developments, which is assumed to be limited as the situation seems to be well controlled. The resumption of international flights in Saudi Arabia towards the end of May will support jet fuel requirements throughout the remainder of the year. On the economic front, infrastructure spending along with an improving industrial sector are expected to lend support to industrial fuels, whereas power generation demand will seasonally pick up pace during 3Q21. In terms of products, middle distillates are projected to return to solid growth. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2020 shows a minor downward revision of 15 tb/d and is estimated to have declined by 2.54 mb/d y-o-y to average 62.89 mb/d. The largest declines were seen in Russia, falling by 1.0 mb/d, and in the US at 0.8 mb/d. Moreover, production also declined in Canada, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil supply is estimated to have increased in Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana. Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2021 has been revised up this month by 0.13 mb/d to average 63.73 mb/d. This is mainly on the back of a faster than expected recovery of 2.5 mb/d in US crude oil and NGLs from the February winter disruption, with growth now forecast at 0.84 mb/d y-o-y. The higher oil supply forecast in Norway, China and Indonesia also supported this revision, although on the flip side there were downward revisions for the UK, Brazil and Colombia. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are expected to be Canada, Brazil, China, and Norway. Started frac operations in US shale surged by 26% between December 2020 and January 2021. Following the plunge in February, frac jobs have remained broadly flat at 840 over the next three months. This has led to an increase in the number of completed wells, also due to a strong draw in the number of DUCs from inventory to raise the number of started new wells in May to the pre-COVID level of around 850 Despite the current recovering trend in US crude oil production, particularly in the Permian Basin, and the expected exit rate at 11.6 mb/d in December 2021, average US crude production in 2021, will remain lower by 0.12 mb/d, y-o-y, at 11.2 mb/d. Following two years of declining OPEC NGLs production in 2019 and 2020 by 0.08 mb/d and 0.17 mb/d respectively, growth of 0.14 mb/d is expected in 2021, to average 5.19 mb/d. OPEC crude oil production in May was up by 0.39 mb/d m-o-m to average 25.46 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Non-OPEC liquids output including OPEC NGLs in May was up by 0.24 mb/d m-o-m to average 68.21 mb/d, a rise of 4.30 mb/d, y-o-y. As a result, world oil supply is estimated to have grown m-o-m in May by 0.63 mb/d to average 93.67 mb/d, up by 5.63 mb/d y-o-y.

According to Rystad Energy estimates, April had 839 frac starts and as already noted, May had 841. Rystad further reported that “The Permian Basin saw a particularly strong start to the month, with around 457 jobs already identified, corresponding to the average seen in March and April. Outside of the Permian, frac counts are building up quickly in south Texas’ Eagle Ford and it is possible that the region will see its count touch the triple digits for the first time since the start of the Covid-19-induced downturn”. Increased fracking would likely help sustain US onshore production as operators bring online their DUC wells. With the strong rebound in US oil fracking activity since the winter slowdown in February, the DUC inventory in major tight oil regions (Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara and Anadarko) saw another months of strong declines in March, April, and May by 144, 191, and 518, respectively.

Norway’s oil supply in 2020 is estimated to have grown by 0.27 mb/d to average 2.00 mb/d, while in 2021, the growth forecast has been revised up by 0.05 mb/d m-o-m, based on lower outages than those expected last month. Production is now expected to average 2.12 mb/d, with growth of 0.12 mb/d y-o-y. In terms of new projects for 2021, Martin Linge is planned for a July and production is expected to reach 53 tb/d. Production from Johan Sverdrup phase-1, which passed the 500 tb/d level in January 2021, is expected to reach 535 tb/d in July and then continue at this level until the end of year. The output of liquids has been affected by maintenance in 2Q21 and production is expected to be lower by 0.11 mb/d vs 1Q21. However, output is anticipated to be higher in 3Q21 by 0.06 mb/d vs 1Q21 to average 2.17 mb/d. This is due to higher production ramp ups from new projects, more than offsetting outages due to maintenance. UK UK liquids production in April was hit by a large Graph 5 15: UK's monthly liquids production outage of 0.25 mb/d, with production dropping to mb/d average 0.79 mb/d. The outage was due to early 1.3 summer maintenance at Troll and the Forties Pipeline 1.2 system that brought a seasonal dip in April’s volume, which is expected to continue into May and June. In 1.1 fact, maintenance is expected to continue into 3Q21, 1.0 albeit with more minor outages. Crude oil production 0.9 in April fell by 216 tb/d m-o-m to average 700 tb/d, 0.8 while NGLs output was down by 35 tb/d to average 0.79 60 tb/d. 0.7 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec In 2021, the main projects where production is ramping up are Mariner, with average production at 2019 2020 2021 44 tb/d, higher by 21 tb/d y-o-y, and Clair Ridge, Sources: Department of Energy & Climate Change and averaging 45 tb/d, up by 10 tb/d y-o-y.

UK liquids supply is forecast to decline by 0.07 mb/d to average 0.99 mb/d, revised down by 23 tb/d m-o-m. Moreover, the upstream sector in the UK is facing a new emission policy of ‘net zero’, known as the North Sea Transitional Deal. “The North Sea Transition Deal unveiled at the end of March aims to set the scene for how the UK’s offshore oil and gas sector and the government will work together to successfully embrace energy transition and meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets” according to Rystad Energy. “In 2019, total emissions for the UK Continental Shelf upstream operations amounted to 13.1 million tonnes of CO2. Almost 30% of total emissions came from the top ten emitting assets, with platforms such as Ninian, Beryl, Elgin, Britannia and Buzzard heading the list. The UK is the first major economy to pass new laws to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050, but it has been criticized over the lack of detail on how this would be achieved”, Rystad Energy highlighted in its analysis. 42 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Oil Supply Non-OECD Non-OECD liquids production for 2020 is estimated to have declined by 1.50 mb/d y-o-y.

Production of NGLs and other non-conventional liquids was mainly flat in April vs March, at 20 tb/d and 240 tb/d, respectively. Liquids output in 1Q21 increased q-o-q by 0.17 mb/d to average 4.25 mb/d, while crude oil output increased by 126 tb/d over the same period. Liquids production in 2Q21 should be at least flat from 1Q21, but as no new large projects are expected to come online in the coming months, lower production is expected for 2H21. Higher NGLs output of 14 tb/d in 1Q21, to average 0.2 mb/d, and increasing non-conventional liquids such as ethanol, biodiesel, and CTLs, which totalled 0.24 mb/d in 1Q21, have contributed to higher China liquids output in 2021 vs 2020. Offshore projects such as, Liuhua 16-2, Liuhua 4-1-1 and to some extent, Jinzhou 24-1, have been the most supportive fields for China’s annual growth in 2021, from which production is expected to grow by around 42 tb/d. Onshore filed production in the current year is anticipated to see y-o-y growth, but at slower rate than last year. The main growth comes from the Changqing, with output expected to reach an average 66 tb/d in 2021.

Production in Ecuador is projected to recover by 0.03 mb/d from outages seen in 2020 to average 0.52 mb/d, albeit revised down by 0.03 mb/d m-o-m. Oil production is likely to decline in Colombia by 0.03 mb/d, which has been revised down by 0.02 mb/d m-o-m. Exxon Mobil reduced crude output at its offshore Liza-1 project in Guyana to 30 tb/d from 13 to 20 April, down from 120 tb/d. This was due to a mechanical problem with the offshore platform’s gas compressor, but it has since begun to slowly ramp up oil production to 100-110 tb/d. In Argentina, oil production is forecast to grow by 0.02 mb/d to average 0.68 mb/d. This is mainly tight crude from Vaca Muerta, which is expected to grow by 29 tb/d in 2021, to average 137 tb/d. However, possible higher natural declines in mature fields may impact anticipated overall growth for the year. Brazil Brazil’s crude oil production in April was up by 128 tb/d m-o-m to average 2.97 mb/d, and up by 13 tb/d y-o-y. Based on preliminary production data, and fewer outages due to lower maintenance and other unplanned outages, May crude production indicates further m-o-m growth of more than 50 tb/d. The initial production forecast for this year has been impacted by the mandated health protection measures initiated by Petrobras on its platforms. Production was temporarily reduced at the Marlim Sul offshore field due to COVID-19-related safety measures, as well as prolonged and unforeseen maintenance weighing on oil production in 1Q21. However, crude oil production is expected to increase in the coming quarters, mainly due to the ramp-up of the Atapu, Berbigao, and Sururu fields within the BM-S-11A block, as well as the start-up of production from the offshore Sepia field. Brazil’s oil production will be boosted through the FPSO Carioca, which is estimated to come online in 2H21 at the Sepia field. The FPSO Carioca will be installed at a water depth of 2,140 m and has a capacity to produce 180 tb/d of crude oil and 212 mscf/d of gas. In terms of liquids, total output in April was up by 0.13 mb/d to average 3.68 mb/d, amid flat production of NGLs and biofuels at 95 tb/d and 614 tb/d, respectively. 44 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – May 2021 World Oil Supply Graph 5 20: Brazil’s crude oil and liquids output Graph 5 21: Brazil’s quarterly and annual liquids output mb/d mb/d 4.0 4.2 3.68 3.98 4.0 Avg. 20 Avg. 21 3.6 Avg. 19 3.68 3.78 3.8 3.2 2.97 3.56 3.6 2.8 3.4 2.4 3.2 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 3.0 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q* 3Q* 4Q* Crude oil output Liquids supply 2019 2020 2021 Sources: ANP, Petrobras and OPEC.

However, heavy natural decline in production in the Campos Basin will partially offset the expected growth in Santos. Apart from the production ramp up in the BM-S-11A block (consisting of the Atapu, Berbigao, and Sururu fields) in the Santos Basin, production at the Buzios field (X-Franco) is expected to reach an annual of average 547 tb/d, a y-o-y growth of 31 tb/d (it is expected to peak at 574 tb/d in 2Q21). CIara, Lapa, Bauna/Piracaba and Sapinhoa are other offshore fields anticipated to see higher output come on stream in 2021, compared to a year ago.

On the US Gulf Coast (USGC) margins increased, supported by unplanned refinery outages that limited a stronger recovery in run rates and kept the product outputs relatively supressed. Margins in Europe and in Asia performed negatively as refining economics showed losses. Pressure came mainly from the top and bottom of the barrel, reflecting the growth in product availability following the maintenance season in Europe and constrained fuel consumption levels due to high case numbers of the new COVID-19 variant in Asia. Refinery margins USGC refining margins rose in May as product supply Graph 6 1: Refining margins cuts and continued improvements in domestic mobility US$/b indicators helped support product markets. At least 15 three USGC refiners that were operating below capacity following the Colonial Pipeline outage 10 contributed to a relatively tighter product balance. 5 However, these refineries resumed operations in May and restored normal production levels. In addition, 0 severe rainstorms and floods affected run rates in at least four refineries in East Texas and Louisiana in -5 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 mid-May, adding to the positive market sentiment in US product markets. US traffic indicators nearly reached pre-pandemic levels, which helped support WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) gasoline consumption as domestic tourism continues Oman (Singapore) to recover, and more service businesses and offices Sources: Argus and OPEC. re-open. US refinery margins for WTI averaged $14.10/b in May, up by $1.27 m-o-m and by $9.18 y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe declined and showed the strongest negative response compared to the other key regions as rising refinery run rates led to stronger product output in the region. This had a negative impact on product crack spreads, particularly of gasoline and fuel oil, despite the relaxation of lockdown measures. Meanwhile, European air travel rose to seven-month highs in the final week of May, with commercial flights having recovered to the highest level since early November 2020. Additional support came from the gasoil segment as strong industrial activity prompted significant gasoil drawdowns. Nonetheless, the strength provided by the middle distillate markets in the US was rather insufficient to offset the negative impact linked to weak regional demand at the top and bottom sections of the barrel, which was exacerbated by the rise in product output are refineries gradually returned from maintenance. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $2.13/b in May, down by 59<U+023C> compared with a month earlier but up by $1.28 y-o-y. In Asia, margins trended downwards for the second consecutive month, with most of the pressure coming from the top and bottom of the barrel, although crude processing rates in the region remained nearly flat. Ample product availability amid waning product import requirements from outside Asia as refiners are returning from major turnarounds prevented any upside in Asian product markets. Moreover, high infection rates for the new COVID-19 variant in India, Vietnam and Taiwan continued to exert pressure on mobility levels within the region and ultimately weighed on transport fuel consumption levels as well as crack spreads. In India, factory activity growth slowed significantly in May as a rise in COVID-19 cases suppressed new orders and output, while rising retail prices of gasoline and gasoil along with lockdowns dented fuel demand. A consumption tax imposed by China on imports of light-cycle oil and mixed aromatic – blending components of gasoil and gasoline, respectively – that takes effect 12 June is set to restrain the nation’s rising gasoline and diesel exports. As a result, China’s refineries are likely to increase run rates and domestic production of gasoil and gasoline in order to compensate for the reduction in light-cycle oil and mixed aromatics imports. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia lost 19¢ m-o-m to average $1.46/b in May, which was higher by $5.18 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 49 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased in May to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 86.91%, which corresponds to a throughput % of 15.72 mb/d. This represented a rise of 1.7 pp and 100 220 tb/d, respectively, compared with the previous 90 month.

Compared with the previous month, throughputs were up by 0.1 pp and by 20 tb/d. Meanwhile, y-o-y, they were up by 5.3 pp and by 1.8 mb/d. Product markets US market US gasoline crack spreads trended upward for the Graph 6 3: US Gulf crack spread vs. WTI sixth consecutive month in May and reached levels US$/b not seen since April 2019. This was mainly driven by 30 strong inventory draws amid supressed refinery 20 outputs due to unplanned outages. US gasoline prices continued to rise, and reached $91.34/b in May, 10 encouraging refineries to maximise gasoline production. Rising margins have pushed the average 0 retail cost of gasoline above $3 per gallon, its highest level since 2014. The effects of the Colonial Pipeline -10 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 outages were evident with USGC gasoline stocks building by 5.7 mb, while US Atlantic Coast (USAC) stock levels declined by nearly 4.6 mb. Nonetheless, Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene nationwide gasoline stocks reversed course and Diesel Fuel oil declined by almost 2 mb. US mobility indicators Sources: Argus and OPEC. appear to have returned to pre-pandemic levels. As refineries continue to return from turnaround season and refinery throughputs rise on the USGC, product markets could come under some pressure in the coming month. US gasoline crack spreads gained 76<U+023C> m-o-m to average $26.16 in May, down by $13.54/b y-o-y. The USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads continued to hold on to recent gains and trended slightly higher in line with steady improvement in domestic air travel, although business and international flights remain subdued. The improvement in jet/kerosene markets was likely limited by a nearly 2.0 mb build in stocks up to 28 May, as rising refinery intakes led to higher jet/kerosene availability and limited the upturn in crack spreads. Going forward, the conclusion of heavy maintenance works should pressure product markets, which could challenge the positive impact from projections of stronger air travel activity over summer. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $8.75/b, up by 27¢ m-o-m, and by 5.72 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI were supported by product stock draws, as they declined steadily over the first three weeks of May, and lost nearly 3.3 mb m-o-m. The improving US diesel demand picture has prompted an increase in larger vessel bookings, as the arbitrage window for European diesel barrels widened. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $5.76/b, up by $1.51 m-o-m and by $6.27 y-o-y. 50 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI weakened, affected by a sustained surplus of international fuel oil supplies due to higher crude runs, although Coker margins appeared supportive in May. Going forward, the weakness in fuel oil markets could trigger additional fuel oil buying interest as secondary feedstock given the current gasoline pricing signals and the transport fuel optimism linked to the summer season. This should limit the fuel oil downturn in the near term. In May, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $4.69/b, lower by 45<U+023C> m-o-m and by 54<U+023C> y-o-y. European market Gasoline crack spreads lost ground, pressured by Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent stronger imports. Departures of European gasoline – US$/b particularly to the US – remained sustained, although 20 gasoline bookings from other countries as well as transatlantic gasoline requirements fell significantly. 10 Moreover, an announcement by the Russian government retracting the previously announced 0 plans to ban gasoline exports accentuated the optimism in European gasoline markets. The gasoline crack spread against Brent averaged $14.65/b in May, -10 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 down by 70<U+023C> m-o-m but up by $5.66 y-o-y. Jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent increased over the month. European air travel rose to a sevenPremium gasoline Jet/Kerosene month high in the final week of May, with commercial Gasoil Fuel oil 1.0% s Sources: Argus and OPEC. flights recovering to the highest level since early November 2020. Travel restrictions in Italy have eased, leading to an increase in flight capacity, while overall Eastern and Western Europe air traffic capacity rose. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $4.72/b, up by 53<U+023C> m-o-m and by $5.28 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads performed positively over the month, supported by solid demand recovery across the region, strengthening industrial performance and gradual removal of mobility restrictions. Furthermore, onshore gasoil stocks in the ARA region have been declining gradually since February and nearly reached historical lows for May. Global commerce dynamics also likely contributed to diesel’s recent strength amid softer volume arrivals from Asia and the Middle East. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $6.07/b, which was higher by 95¢ m-o-m and by 78<U+023C> y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads continued to trend downwards, affected by a reduction in volume requirements from the Middle East while imports remained flat. This resulted in stronger fuel oil availability in the region and was exacerbated by the return of distillation capacity in Europe following peak turnarounds. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $11.28/b in May, having lost $2.71 m-o-m and $3.38 y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92-crack spread suffered losses Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai as gasoline sales in India collapsed to the lowest level US$/b in a year as a devastating wave of COVID-19 10 infections supressed consumption.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Asia naphtha crack spreads weakened and entered negative territory, affected by a sharp widening of the gasoline/naphtha spread to a 13-month high. Seasonal naphtha demand is relatively low due to regular steam cracker maintenance and has been further pressured by an unexpected slowdown of PTTGC’s Mab Ta Phut steam crackers in Thailand due to problems with power supply, according to Argus Media. Japan has increasingly been importing naphtha over the last few months, with February and March imports averaging around 140 tb/d (35% higher than in 2020), and over 100 tb/d in May (27% higher than a year earlier). Going forward, Asian naphtha markets are expected to remain well supported by the petrochemical industry with the conclusion of steam cracker maintenance. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged minus 47<U+023C>/b, having increased slightly by 5¢ m-o-m, and by $3.39 y-o-y. In the middle of the barrel, the jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia gained some ground with support from continued regional requirements for domestic air travel, mainly in China. However, the majority of international flights remain suspended due to prolonged border restrictions amid outbreaks of the new COVID-19 variant in many parts of Asia, while business travel is still being avoided as much as possible. Jet fuel supplies in the region are limited as refiners have kept a cap on production due to weaker refining margins. The end of winter in Northeast Asia and subsequent decline in kerosene consumption for heating could weigh further on jet/kerosene markets in the near term. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $5.30/b, up by $1.48 m-o-m and $6.71 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spreads moved higher as well with a strong rise in exports of gasoil/ diesel from the region’s largest exporters such as India, China, South Korea and Taiwan. Japan, where a lack of local demand has resulted in a considerable build in diesel stocks, faces challenges placing barrels in export markets. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $5.70/b, up by 89<U+023C>/b m-o-m and up by $2.01 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spreads continued to trend downwards, affected by stronger crude intake levels, which had an adverse effect on fuel oil prices and resulted in weaker cracks. A seasonal uptick in requirements from the power generation sector in the coming months should limit this downside in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $8.71/b, down by $2.87 m-o-m and by $3.28 y-o-y.

The improving US market supported rates on the UK-US route, while very low rates on the Mideast-Asia Pacific route edged up amid anticipation of the end of seasonal maintenance. Meanwhile, clean rates were largely steady, with rates on the UK to US Atlantic Coast boosted earlier in the month, supported by disruptions on the Colonial Pipeline. There has been a slight improvement in sentiment regarding the outlook for dirty tanker rates in 2H21, although scrapping will need to pick up to better balance ample tonnage supply with slightly improving cargo demand. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in May, falling by 1.3 mb/d, or around 8%, to average 14.7 mb/d. Spot fixtures were around 2.2 mb/d, or 13%, lower than the same month last year. A pickup in departures to China helped support fixtures, although uncertainties due to lockdown measures in other Asian countries undercut further gains.

OPEC spot fixtures edged lower m-o-m in May, down by 0.1 mb/d, or a little over 1%, to average 10.0 mb/d. Higher flows to China were offset by lower volumes to Japan and India amid renewed lockdown measures. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were around 9% lower, down by 0.9 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East provided the one bright note for the month, averaging 6.2 mb/d in May, representing an increase of 18% m-o-m or 0.9 mb/d. Gains were driven by increased inflows from the region to China, with the winding down of seasonal maintenance. Y-o-y, the route saw a decline of 0.7 mb/d, or just under 10%. Middle East-to-West fixtures declined 29%, or around 0.3 mb/d m-o-m, to average around 0.9 mb/d. The decrease was due to lower buying in the Eastern Mediterranean which offset increased flows to Italy. This was almost 0.2 mb/d, or 18%, lower than in the same month last year. Outside Middle East fixtures fell by more than 0.7 mb/d, or close to 20% m-o-m, to average 3.0 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were down by just over 4%, or around 0.1 mb/d. Sailings and arrivals OPEC sailings were broadly unchanged in May from the previous month, averaging 21.4 mb/d. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings were slightly lower, down 0.1 mb/d, or less than 1%. Middle East sailings picked up m-o-m in May to average 15.7 mb/d. This represents a gain of 0.4 mb/d m-o-m or around 3%. Y-o-y, sailings from the region increased 1.3 mb/d, or 9%, compared with the same month last year. With the exception of West Asia, crude arrivals were higher m-o-m on all routes in May. Arrivals in North America averaged 8.5 mb/d, representing a gain of 0.2 mb/d m-o-m, or around 2%, and a 0.7 mb/d, or over 8% increase y-o-y. Arrivals in the Far East averaged 12.6 mb/d, an increase of 0.2 mb/d, or around 1% m-o-m, and a massive 4.3 mb/d, or 53%, higher than the same month last year. Arrivals in West Asia saw the sole m-o-m decline, falling 0.2 mb/d, or close to 3%, to average 6.3 mb/d. Y-o-y, West Asia arrivals were 1.7 mb/d, or 37%, higher.

Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates in May were broadly flat on average compared to the previous month, but were some 40% lower compared with the same month last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-East ticked up 3% m-o-m to average WS34 points, supported by flows to China ahead of the end of seasonal maintenance. Gains were tempered by lower flows to India and Japan, amid uncertainties due to renewed lockdown measures. Y-o-y, rates were 43% below the same month last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route was unchanged on average m-o-m in May at WS22 points, amid steady buying by Italy. Y-o-y, rates were 35% lower. Meanwhile, the West Africa-to-East route showed gains of 3% m-o-m in May, averaging WS36, amid higher buying by China. Rates were 38% lower compared with May 2020.

The Middle East-to-East route led losses in May, declining 22% to average WS93. The decline came amid uncertainty due to renewed lockdown measures in Japan. This represented a 63% decrease compared with the same month last year. A similar dynamic drove the m-o-m decline in clean freight rates on the Singaporeto-East route, which slipped 1% in May to average WS146. Rates were 40% lower compared with May 2020. In contrast, the Cross-Med and Med-to-NWE routes saw gains, increasing by 1% each, to average WS149 and WS159 points, respectively. Rates on the NWE-to-USEC route experienced the biggest gains m-o-m, up 7%, to average WS132 points. Rates were 8% lower compared with the same month last year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – June 2021 57 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d m-o-m in May to average 6.0 mb/d, the highest in 11 months. US crude exports dipped again, averaging 2.8 mb/d in May, amid lower buying from the Asian region. US product imports showed a strong performance in May, averaging 2.8 mb/d, the highest since 2011, driven by European flows as well as a dislocations caused by an outage on the main product pipeline serving the US East Coast. With the start of the driving season and a pickup in economic activity, US crude and product trade flows will provide key support for the market in the coming months, together with OECD Europe. Tracking data shows a steady increase in OECD Europe crude imports from February onward and declining crude exports amid lower production and improving demand in 2Q21 as lockdown measures ease. Japan’s crude imports hit a 13-month high in May, averaging 2.7 mb/d. Product imports were relatively steady m-o-m averaging 1.0 mb/d, with the decline in kerosene offsetting gains in most major products. A series of refinery outages in May is likely to boost product imports while dampening crude imports and product exports. As forecast, China’s crude imports dropped to just below 10 mb/d in May, amid planned refinery maintenance, with a further decline in May to a five-month low of 9.65 mb/d seen in preliminary data. China’s crude imports are expected to remain low in 2Q21, before picking up again in 3Q21. Stricter oversight of refinery activities and the end of a tax loophole is likely to weigh on both product imports and exports in the coming months. Meanwhile, India’s crude imports recovered from a five-month low in May to average 4.5 mb/d. A vicious surge in COVID-19 cases which reached record levels in mid-May will likely weigh on demand for crude imports for that month and June, with local refiners expecting the situation to improve in July. Constrained domestic consumption could free up product for exports over the period. US Preliminary data shows that US crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d m-o-m, or more than 3%, in May to average 6.1 mb/d, representing an 11-month high. Imports have steadily risen since October 2020, with the exception of February 2021 when disruptions caused by the severe winter weather disrupted trade flows. Compared to the same month last year, crude imports were broadly flat, at less than 1% lower.

Compared to the same month last year, crude exports were less than 0.1 mb/d lower, or down around 3%. The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination shows generally lower flows with mixed movement across the regions.

US net crude imports averaged 3.2 mb/d in May, compared to 2.9 mb/d the month before and 3.2 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US product imports enjoyed a strong performance in May, averaging 2.8 mb/d, the highest since 2011. This represents an increase of 0.3 mb/d or 13% m-o-m and a gain of 1.1 mb/d over the same month last year. The high levels were supported by an outage on the Colonial Pipeline which transports petroleum products from the US Gulf Coast to the US Northeast. The disruption of the 2.5 mb/d pipeline triggered increased imports from Europe to the US Atlantic Coast to help make up the sudden shortfall. US product exports also showed a strong performance in May, averaging 5.7 mb/d, representing an almost 11% increase m-o-m and building on similar gains in the previous month. Y-o-y, product exports were a massive 1.8 mb/d, or 45%, higher, reflecting the extreme impact of COVID-19 disruptions seen in May 2020. As a result, US net product exports averaged 2.8 mb/d in May, compared with 2.6 mb/d the month before and 2.2 mb/d in May 2020. Preliminary data indicates that the US remained a net crude and product importer in May, with net inflows of close to 0.4 mb/d. This compares with net imports of almost 0.3 mb/d the month before and 0.9 mb/d in May 2020.

Y-o-y, crude inflows edged up 56 tb/d m-o-m, or almost 10%. As a result, net crude imports averaged almost 6.2 mb/d in February, down from 7.0 mb/d the month before and 8.6 mb/d in the same month of 2020. On the product side, imports declined, averaging 2.5 mb/d, representing a loss of 0.3 mb/d, or almost 11%. The drop was mainly driven by naphtha, while motor gasoline and diesel registered gains. Y-o-y, OECD Europe product inflows were sharply lower, down 2.2 mb/d, or 25%. Product exports recovered partly from the decline seen the month before, averaging 2.4 mb/d. This represents a gain of 0.1 mb/d or over 4% from the previous month, driven by primarily by diesel.
