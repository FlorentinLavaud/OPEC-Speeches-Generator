The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) averaged $73.53/b in July, representing an increase of $1.64, or 2.3%, m-o-m, the highest level since October 2018. Year-to-date, the ORB was up $25.43, or 63.8%, compared with the same period last year, to average $65.27/b. Crude oil futures prices also extended gains in July, buoyed by the outlook for strong oil market fundamentals. The ICE Brent front month increased by 88¢, or 1.2%, m-o-m to average $74.29/b in July, while NYMEX WTI gained $1.08, or 1.5%, m-o-m to average $72.43/b. Consequently, the Brent/WTI futures spread narrowed further in July by 20¢ to $1.86/b, its narrowest since October 2020. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in steep backwardation in July, as the oil market outlook remained robust and the market rebalancing process continued, amid a further decline in OECD oil stocks. However, hedge funds and other money managers sharply reduced their net long positions in July, particularly in WTI, after a selloff was seen in US equity markets and concerns heightened about the rapid spread of the Delta variant. World Economy Global economic growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 were revised up by 0.1 pp, and hence growth for 2021 now stands at 5.6%, while growth in 2022 is now expected at 4.2%. However, the forecast for global growth continues to be impacted by uncertainties, including the spread of COVID-19 variants and the pace of the vaccine rollout worldwide. In addition, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with inflationary pressures and central bank responses, remain key factors that require close monitoring. After lower-thanexpected 2Q21 GDP growth, US economic growth for 2021 is revised down to 6.1% from 6.4% previously, while growth for 2022 is revised up to 4.1% from 3.6%. Euro-zone economic growth in 2021 is revised up to 4.7% from 4.1%, while growth for 2022 is revised up to 3.8% from 3%. Japan’s economic growth forecast remains at 2.8% for 2021, followed by growth of 2.0% in 2022. Meanwhile, China’s economic growth forecast for 2022 is revised down to 6% from 6.3%, following growth of 8.5% in 2021, unchanged from the previous month’s assessment. India’s 2021 growth forecast is revised down to 9.3%, followed by growth of 6.8% in 2022. Brazil’s growth forecast for 2021 is revised up to 4.2% from 3.2%, followed by growth of 2.5% in 2022. Russia’s forecast for both 2021 and 2022 is revised up by 0.2 pp to stand at 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively. World Oil Demand World oil demand growth expectations for 2021 remained unchanged from the previous month’s assessment. This is despite the above slight upward revision to economic growth, as the upwardly revised increment of the economic recovery is projected to be mainly in non-oil-intensive sectors. Oil demand is still estimated to increase by around 6.0 mb/d to average 96.6 mb/d. However, some revisions were taken into account in 1Q21 due to slower-than-anticipated demand in OECD Americas, offset by better-than-expected data from nonOECD countries in 2Q21. For 2022, world oil demand is still projected to increase by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y, unchanged from last month’s assessment. Total world oil demand is projected to surpass the 100 mb/d threshold in 2H22 and reach 99.9 mb/d on average for the whole of 2022. Economic activities are still projected to gain traction, supported by massive stimulus packages. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be controlled by vaccination programmes and improved treatment, resulting in a further recovery in economic activity and a steady rise in oil demand in both the OECD and non-OECD. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth forecasts in 2021 and 2022 have been revised up by 0.27 mb/d and 0.84 mb/d, respectively. These revisions are mainly due to the incorporation of the latest production adjustment decision of the non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), which are now considered, following the successful conclusion of the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 18 July 2021. In addition, supply from the US and Canada is also subject to revisions this month. Non-OPEC liquids are now expected to grow by 1.1 mb/d in 2021 to average 64.0 mb/d. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are anticipated to be Canada, Russia, China, the US, Norway and Brazil, with the US now expected to see y-o-y growth of 0.12 mb/d. For 2022, liquids supply is now expected to grow by 2.9 mb/d following new incremental production adjustments by the DoC’s non-OPEC members, led by Russia with 1.0 mb/d. The US, with y-o-y growth of 0.8 mb/d, together with Brazil, Norway, Canada and Guyana, will be the other key drivers. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in both 2021 and 2022 to average 5.2 mb/d and 5.3 mb/d, respectively. OPEC crude oil production in July increased by 0.64 mb/d m-o-m, to average 26.66 mb/d, according to available secondary sources. Product Markets and Refining Operations Global refinery margins trended upwards in July, supported by seasonal strength in transport fuels, with robust performance registered at the top of the barrel. In the US, a counter-seasonal decline in refinery utilization rates and subsequent downward pressure on product inventories lifted product markets. In Europe, refining margins benefitted from a reduction in utilization rates within the region registered in late June, as well as a tighter balance in major product markets due to limited product arrivals. This took place amid sustained road transport fuel consumption linked to softer mobility restrictions. Meanwhile, healthy regional fuel consumption levels in Asia, as well as robust petrochemical feedstock demand led to gains for clean products. Tanker Market Market developments in the month of July provided little momentum to the languishing tanker market, with dirty freight rates remaining at subdued levels. While the demand for tankers is expected to pick up in 2H21, reducing some of the excess in tonnage availability amid increased scrapping, the rapid spread of the Delta variant has added some uncertainty regarding demand for products and crude, potentially pushing the tanker market recovery further into 2022. Crude and Refined Products Trade US crude imports were broadly flat in July at near 18-month highs, averaging 6.5 mb/d, while crude exports dropped back to 2.7 mb/d, amid reduced flows to India. Japan’s crude imports plunged almost 20% m-o-m in June to average 1.9 mb/d, undermined by renewed lockdown measures and reduced expectations for a boost in consumption due to the Olympic Games in Tokyo. Meanwhile, China’s crude imports rose m-o-m in June, but remained at lower levels, averaging 9.8 mb/d, as government efforts to rein-in teapot refineries and crackdown on import quotas and tax irregularities dampened inflows. China’s crude imports are expected to be capped close to current levels over the coming months as refiners continue to destock within increased government oversight. India’s crude imports fell further in June, reaching an eight-month low of 3.9 mb/d, affected by refinery maintenance and ongoing Delta variant impacts. In contrast, India’s product imports rebounded by 20% m-o-m to average 0.9 mb/d, led by a strong jump in LPG and naphtha inflows, as economic activity returned. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data for June sees total OECD commercial oil stocks down by 23.0 mb m-o-m. At 2,922 mb, inventories are 289.4 mb lower than the same month a year ago, 90.4 mb lower than the latest five-year average and 25.2 mb below the 2015–2019 average. Within components, crude stocks fell by 38.3 mb m-o-m and product stocks were up by 15.3 mb. At 1,416 mb, OECD crude stocks stood 96.2 mb below the latest five-year average and 70.5 mb below the 2015–2019 average. Measuring 1,507 mb, OECD product stocks exhibited a gain of 5.8 mb above the latest five-year average, and were 45.3 mb above the 2015–2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks fell m-o-m by 0.9 days in June to stand at 63.6 days. This is 12.4 days below June 2020 levels, 1.0 day below the latest five-year average, but 2.0 days above the 2015–2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 was revised down by 0.2 mb/d from the previous month assessment to stand at 27.4 mb/d, around 4.7 mb/d higher than in 2020. Demand for OPEC crude in 2022 was revised down by 1.1 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 27.6 mb/d, around 0.2 mb/d higher than in 2021. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Crude and product price movements The global oil market has seen a significant Graph 1: Transatlantic spread between Brent and WTI improvement in its fundamentals this year, US$/b US$/b translating into lower crude oil price volatility 80 12 compared with 2020.

Market confidence has also improved as OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) maintained strong conformity levels in their voluntary production adjustments. However, the most current resurgence of new COVID-19 variants in several regions has impacted oil prices in recent days. In terms of market structure, the backwardation of major crude benchmarks had strengthened since early 2021, mirroring stronger market fundamentals. The ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI M1-M3 spread both widened again in July to a backwardation of about $1.5/b, on expectations of a market deficit in 2H21. The transatlantic spread between ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI tightened in 2Q21 and continued to narrow in July, to settle at $1.86/b. WTI futures performed better than ICE Brent, as the rebalancing process in the US accelerated, amid robust oil demand and strong economic growth in that country, slow growth in oil supply and a large decline in crude stocks. On the product side, fuel prices showed a substantial Graph 2: Refined product prices in the USGC recovery this year in response to stronger crude US$/b prices. Moreover, the lifting of restrictions and 120 subsequent improvement in fuel consumption levels 100 helped ease the product surplus seen in 2020. In 80 addition, the seasonal uptick in personal transport 60 mobility activity in summer provided further support. 40 At the top of the barrel, gasoline production in the US 20 in 1H21 was affected by the arctic freeze, the 0 Colonial pipeline shutdown, spring floods and the Jan 19 Mar 19 May 19 Jul 19 Sep 19 Nov 19 Jan 20 Mar 20 May 20 Jul 20 Sep 20 Nov 20 Jan 21 Mar 21 May 21 Jul 21 turnaround season. As a result, US gasoline supplies suffered a considerable contraction, which led to sharp downward pressure on inventory levels and Jet/kerosene Gasoline Gasoil Fuel oil pushed gasoline prices to skyrocket back to preSources: Argus and OPEC. COVID levels (Graph 2). This gasoline shortage in the US opened up export opportunities and helped gasoline prices, to a more limited extent, in other regions as well. At the middle of the barrel, global gasoil prices remained sustained, supported by healthy economic activity, although jet/kerosene prices in Asia and in Europe lagged, due to the weak recovery in international and business air travel. High sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices in all regions rose, although volume availability surged in the US and Asia amid weak demand. In July, stronger LNG prices, robust power demand and hot weather all point to a boost in HSFO consumption and crack spreads. Looking forward, refined product prices in 2H21 are likely to continue benefiting from a seasonal strength in transport fuels, although current high refinery run rates could dampen some of the upside in the immediate near term. Moreover, changes in crude prices, as well as a potential decline in fuel output over the peak autumn maintenance season, particularly around September, could lead to additional product price volatility. Meanwhile, unplanned outages, especially weather-related supply disruptions due to a forecast heavy hurricane season in the US, and concerns over possible renewed lockdowns, may also add to the volatility. Amid this precarious outlook, the vigilance and determined efforts by the countries participating in the DoC will remain ever more important in striving to maintain a stable and balanced market.

The increase in buying interest from refiners in July compared with previous months also supported spot prices. In July, North Sea Dated rose the most by $2.03, or 2.8% m-o-m, to an average of $74.99/b. The WTI and Dubai's first month increased respectively by $1.20 and $1.33, or 1.7% m-o-m and 1.9%, to settle at $72.58/b and $72.83/b. The ORB gained $1.64 on average in July, an increase of 2.3% m-o-m, to settle at $73.53/b, its highest level since October 2018. ORB component values rose on higher related crude oil benchmarks, and a higher monthly change in their respective official selling price differentials for most components, particularly to the European market. Crude oil futures prices ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI first-month contracts ended July about 1.2% and 1.5% higher m-o-m in a relatively volatile month. Crude oil futures prices remained buoyed by strong oil market fundamentals, primarily driven by robust market fundamentals, which points to a significant oil market deficit in 2H21. However, the fast spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant raised concerns over the short-term demand outlook and limited oil price gains. The ICE Brent front-month increased by 88¢ m-o-m, or 1.2%, in July to average $74.29/b, and NYMEX WTI rose by $1.08 m-o-m, or 1.5%, to average $72.43/b. ICE Brent was $24.30, or 57.5%, higher y-t-d at $66.57/b, while NYMEX WTI was $26.29, or 70.3% higher, at $63.70/b, compared with the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in July by 99¢ m-o-m, or 1.4%, to settle at $72.73/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $23.02 m-o-m, or 54.6%, at $65.17/b. Hedge funds and other money managers sharply reduced their net long positions in July, particularly in NYMEX WTI, after a selloff took place in US equity markets, given the concerns about the rapid spread of the new Delta variant in several major economies, in addition to expectations of increasing global oil supply. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in steep backwardation in July, as oil market fundamentals remained solid, while the market rebalancing process continued amid a further decline in OECD oil stocks. The premium of light sweet to medium sour crudes widened in July in all regions due to stronger light distillate margins compared with heavier distillates, and as outright prices of light sweet Brent improved markedly compared with sour grades. The expectation of a gradual increase of sour crude supply also contributed to widening sweet-sour crude differentials. Crude spot prices Crude oil spot prices averaged higher in July, amid Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement a volatile futures market, as solid physical market US$/b fundamentals and an easing inventory overhang, 80 including in the Atlantic Basin, supported prices. In 70 July, North Sea Dated rose the most by $2.03 m-o-m, or 2.8%, to an average of $74.99/b, supported by firm 60 demand in the Atlantic Basin, particularly in the US 50 and Europe. WTI and Dubai's first months increased respectively by $1.20 and $1.33 m-o-m, or 1.7% and 40 1.9%, to settle at $72.58/b and $72.83/b.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements Refiners in several large consuming countries increased their crude runs in recent months. In the US, the refinery net input of crude oil rose to about 16.2 mb/d in June, according to EIA weekly data and remained above 16 mb/d on average in July, while utilization of refinery operable capacity averaged about 91.6%. In China, crude refinery throughput continued to increase and, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, crude oil processing rose in June to 60.82 million tons, compared with 60.5 million tons in May. However, in the second decade of July, spot prices dropped amid a strong decline in futures markets, fuelled by the quick spread of the Delta variant in several major consuming countries, including the US, China, Japan and part of Europe, in addition to other South Asian and African countries, raising concerns about a potential drag on oil demand. Spot crude prices corrected higher over the last week of July on supportive oil market fundamentals. Nonetheless, the uptrend was capped by lingering concerns regarding the rise of COVID-19 infections in several countries and potential further tightening of mobility restrictions that could curb oil demand.

Crude oil differentials were mixed in July, specifically for light sweet crude, as a strong North Sea Dated and steep backwardation weighed on crude differentials. Crude differentials in the West African, Mediterranean and Caspian markets diverged but, monthly averages were little changed. A strong Brent value compared with Dubai made Brent-related crudes less attractive for Asian refiners and limited west-to-east arbitrage. Higher competitiveness from US crudes in Europe also added downward pressure. Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe crude differentials fell in July against the Brent benchmark by a monthly average of 3¢, 21¢ and 19¢, respectively, to premiums of 31¢/b, 38¢/b and 35¢/b. The Caspian CPC Blend differential also eased in July by 3¢ to a discount of $1.46/b on average, rising by 93¢/b m-o-m, while Saharan Blend crude differentials averaged a discount of 5¢/b, rising by 12¢/b m-o-m. The crude differential of medium-heavy sweet Cabinda fell in July by 7¢ m-o-m to settle at a premium of 34¢/b. However, light sweet crude differentials in Northwest Europe strengthened in July, supported by firm demand from European refiners and healthy refining margins, driven up 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements by higher gasoline and naphtha margins. Forties and Ekofisk crude differentials rose by 89¢ and 67¢, respectively, on a monthly average in July to settle at a premium of $1.09/b and $1.25/b. In the US, a narrow Brent-WTI spread weighed on waterborne crude differentials in the Gulf Coast (USGC), limiting export arbitrage opportunities. Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars crude differentials deepened further in July, falling by 94¢ and $1.18, respectively, on a monthly average, to a premium of 57¢/b and a discount of $2.01/b. However, in the Middle East, the value of most Dubai-related crudes on the spot market rose on robust demand from Asia Pacific refiners, especially from China and India, in addition to widening BrentDubai differentials that limited west-to-east arbitrage opportunities. The value of the Oman crude differential rose by 47¢ m-o-m in July to a premium of $2.45/b. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB value gained $1.64 on average in July, an increase of 2.3% m-o-m, to settle at $73.53/b, its highest point since October 2018. ORB component values rose on higher related crude oil benchmarks, and a higher monthly change in their respective official selling price differentials for most components, particularly to the European market. Compared with the previous year, the year-to-date ORB was up by $25.43, or 63.8%, from $39.85/b in 2020 to an average of $65.27/b so far this year. All ORB component values rose in July, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend, and Zafiro – increasing $2.43, or 3.4%, m-o-m on average, to $73.93/b. Multiple region destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy, and Kuwait Export – rose by $1.39, or 1.9%, m-o-m on average to settle at $73.58/b. Murban crude rose by $1.30, or 1.8%, m-o-m on average, to settle at $73.64/b. The Merey component also increased by 97¢, or 1.8%, m-o-m on average to settle at $54.49/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI first-month contracts ended July respectively 1.2% and 1.5% higher m-o-m over a relatively volatile month. Crude oil futures prices started the month generally higher, extending the previous months’ gains, as the market continued to be supported by strong oil market fundamentals, primarily driven by robust oil demand growth outlooks and expectations of slow global oil supply growth, which point to a significant oil supply/demand deficit in 2H21. A strong driving season in the US, improved road transportation fuels in Europe, firmed demand in China, and a steady oil demand recovery in India after the easing of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions bolstered global oil demand outlooks. Moreover, improving refinery intakes in major refining centres, and encouraging global economic data, particularly in the US, China, and Europe, added optimism to market sentiment. Uncertainty about the global oil supply also pushed oil prices higher. However, futures markets entered a turbulent zone in the second decade of July with heightening volatility, triggered by rising concerns about the rapid spread of the new COVID-19 Delta variant in several major economies and a broad selloff in US equity markets. Additionally, speculation about a supply overhang after OPEC and non-OPEC producers in the DoC decided to voluntarily adjust their production gradually higher as from August played a role. These factors combined contributed to the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI prompt month falling by 6.8% and 7.5%, respectively, in one session on 19 July. Surging Delta infections in major economies, including the US, China, Japan, the UK, and parts of Europe, along with other regions, and the reinstatement of lockdowns and mobility restriction measures in several South Asian countries, weighed on market sentiment.

Sources: CME, DME, ICE and OPEC. Crude futures prices recovered slightly in the third decade of July and rose further towards the end of the month after investors turned more optimistic on the global oil demand recovery amid expectations that higher vaccination rates in major economies would mitigate the negative impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, the global oil supply/demand balance continued to show a deficit in 2H21, despite the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements announced OPEC and non-OPEC upward output adjustments. Oil prices were also buoyed by declining OECD oil stocks, particularly in the US, in a sign of a continuing rebalancing process. The ICE Brent front-month increased by 88¢ m-o-m, or 1.2%, in July to average $74.29/b, and NYMEX WTI rose by $1.08 m-o-m, or 1.5%, to average $72.43/b. ICE Brent was $24.30 higher y-t-d, or 57.5%, at $66.57/b, while NYMEX WTI was $26.29 higher, or 70.3%, at $63.70/b, compared with the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in July by 99¢ m-o-m, or 1.4%, to settle at $72.73/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $23.02, or 54.6%, at $65.17/b. On 11 August, ICE Brent stood at $71.44/b and NYMEX WTI at $69.25/b. The NYMEX WTI crude front-month discount to the same ICE Brent futures month narrowed further in July by 20¢ to $1.86/b, its lowest point since October 2020, making US crude for export less attractive for arbitrage into both Europe and Asia. The NYMEX WTI benchmark continued to perform better than ICE Brent in July, as the US market showed signs of accelerating the rebalancing process. Strong oil demand in the US in the driving season and rising refinery throughput, along with slow shale production growth and low imports, tightened the US market and contributed to a sharp decline in US crude and oil product stocks, which firmly supported the US benchmark. US crude oil stocks declined by nearly 44 mb between the week of 28 May and 23 July, to their lowest level since late January. However, the North Sea Dated premium to WTI Houston widened in July by $1.09 m-o-m, to average $2.11/b, due to firm North Sea crude values that were supported in July by low availability and strong demand from European refiners. In the meantime, crude values in the USGC came under pressure amid a strong NYMEX WTI-related benchmark and lower arbitrage opportunities. According to weekly US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, US crude exports fell below 2.5 mb/d in the weeks to 16 and 23 July. Hedge funds and other money managers massively reduced their net long positions in July, particularly in NYMEX WTI, after a selloff in US equity markets took place and heightening concerns were seen regarding the rapid spread of the new COVID-19 Delta variant in several major economies, including in the US and China. Additionally, global oil supply was expected to increase. Large sales in July probably contributed to pushing oil futures prices lower. Nonetheless, speculators recovered part of their net long positions in the week to 27 July after oil prices rose from the previous week's low levels. In the week to 27 July, combined futures and options net long positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI were 11.6%, or 83,063, contracts lower compared with the level in the week to 29 June at 715,957 contracts. Between the week of 29 June and the week ending 27 July, money managers were net sellers of about 83 mb of both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI.

Sources: ICE and OPEC. Despite sharp selling in the week to 20 July, money managers recovered most of their net long positions in Brent the following week, as speculators closed more short positions. Compared with the week to 29 June, combined futures and options net long positions in Brent increased slightly by 3,258 contracts, or 1.1%, to reach 311,659 lots in the week to 27 July, according to the ICE Exchange. In the week ending 27 July, gross short positions fell by 31,465 lots, or 28.3%, to 79,616 contracts, while gross long positions declined by 28,207 lots, or 6.7%, to 391,275 contracts during the same period. However, money managers turned less optimistic about crude prices and sharply cut their optimistic positions on WTI in July, as the spread of the Delta variant, including in the US, and its potential negative impact on oil demand, seemed to weigh on speculator sentiment. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements Combined WTI futures and options net long positions decreased by 86,321 contracts, or 21.2%, to 321,235 lots in the week to 27 July. This was due to a rise in short positions by 20,601 lots, or 78.9%, to 46,718 contracts, while long positions fell by 65,720 contracts, or 15.2%, to 367,953 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The futures market structure Despite a volatile market and the Delta variant resurgence weighing on sentiment, the market structure of all three major oil benchmarks remained in steep backwardation in July, as oil market fundamentals stayed solid and the market rebalancing process continued amid a further decline in OECD oil stocks. Forecasts continue to point to a significant supply/demand deficit in 2H21. The prospect of slow non-OPEC oil supply growth and a gradual adjustment to crude production from DoC countries also contributed to maintaining market backwardation.

The Brent forward curve remained in sustained backwardation in July and steepened further in the front, where the ICE Brent first-to-third month spread widened by 26¢ to $1.55/b on average, compared with $1.29/b in June. Firm demand in Europe, an easing supply overhang in the Atlantic Basin, and the prospect of a gradual supply increase from DoC producers supported prompt prices. ICE Brent’s first-to-sixth month also moved into deeper backwardation last month to settle at $3.54/b on average, compared with a backwardation of $3.04/b one month earlier. The ICE Brent forward curve remained in backwardation in the back end of the curve. In the US, the backwardation structure of NYMEX WTI also strengthened last month and the forward curve steepened on the front on improving market fundamentals in the driving season and the prospect of tightening US oil market supply/demand fundamentals in the short term. The high vaccination rate in the US lent some optimism for the oil demand recovery, despite the spread of the Delta variant. Strengthening oil demand and recovering US refinery throughput, along with a sharp decline in US crude stocks, including in Cushing, Oklahoma, supported near-month contracts. Crude oil stocks in Cushing fell by about 10 mb, or about 22%, between the weeks of 4 June and 23 July, according to EIA weekly data. The NYMEX WTI first-to-third month spread widened by 41¢ to a backwardation of $1.48/b on average in July, compared with a backwardation of $1.07/b one month earlier. Despite prospects of gradually rising crude supply in the Middle East from August under the DoC decision, the forward structure of DME Oman and Dubai remained in steep backwardation as prompt prices endured, supported by firm Asian demand and lower arbitrage opportunities from the Atlantic Basin amid a wide BrentDubai spread. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1/M3 spread widened by 43¢ to a backwardation of $1.79/b in July. Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread widened in July on a monthly average by 23¢ to a backwardation of $1.55/b, compared with $1.31/b in June. In the US, the WTI M1/M3 backwardation also widened in July by 44¢ to $1.41/b, compared with a backwardation of 98¢b in June. The Dubai M1/M3 backwardation widened on average in July by 53¢ to a backwardation of $2.34/b. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Crude spreads The premium of light sweet to medium sour crudes widened in July in all regions, particularly Asia, due to stronger light distillate margins compared with heavier distillates, and as outright prices from light sweet Brent improved markedly compared with sour grades. An easing supply overhang of light sweet crude in the Atlantic Basin and the expectation of a gradual increase of sour crude supply in line with the DoC decision also contributed to widening sweet-sour crude differentials. In Europe, the spread between North Sea Dated and Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC Urals widened again in July by 51¢ to average $1.90/b. US$/b The sour grade value weakened against the North Sea 8 Dated benchmark due to the availability of unsold 6 cargoes for August loading amid subdued European 4 demand and unfavorable arbitrage to the Asian market as the Brent-Dubai exchange of futures for swaps 2 contract (EFS) widened, making flow to the east 0 difficult. Expectations of higher sour crude supply from -2 August and weak fuel oil margins also put downward pressure on Urals. In the meantime, light sweet crude Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 in Northwest Europe strengthened on robust buying interest, including from Europe, amid rising European Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals oil demand and higher light distillate margins, LLS-Mars particularly for gasoline and naphtha. Crack naphtha Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. in Northwest Europe rose to a premium in July. In the USGC, the LLS premium over medium sour Mars also increased in July by 24¢ on average to $2.57/b, as it continued to be supported by higher refining margins in the region compared with medium sour crude. Furthermore, the value of sour crude Mars came under greater pressure on difficult arbitrage to Asia, while the value of light sweet crude in the USGC remained underpinned by strong light sweet crudes in the Atlantic Basin. Similarly, in Asia, the Tapis premium over Dubai widened last month on better performance of light product margins, particularly naphtha, compared with heavier margins, and as light sweet crudes in Asia became more competitive due to a wide Brent-Dubai spread, which makes the flow of west to east arbitrage for Atlantic Basin crudes unfordable. The Brent-Dubai front-month exchange of futures for swaps (EFS Dubai) rose by 32¢ in July on average to $3.95/b. The expectation of a higher supply of sour crude in the Middle East from August also contributed to widening sweet-sour crude differentials. The Tapis-Dubai spread widened by $1.96 m-o-m in July, to average $4.41/b. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodities rose in July, led by a jump in natural gas and coal prices. Strong demand for power generation amid localized heatwaves, robust industrial activity and some supply restrictions lifted natural gas and coal prices across all regions. Crude oil prices rose, supported by strong oil market fundamentals outlook. Base metals weakened at the beginning of the month of July, as the pace of expansion in global manufacturing eased for a second consecutive month, but prices recovered on supply concerns and some easing in the value of the dollar at the end of the month. Gold prices declined as in the previous month on expectations of a faster-than-anticipated interest rate increase in the US. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index rose m-o-m by 4.8% in July. As in the previous two months, crude oil, natural gas and coal rose across all regions. The average index level was up by 67% in the period January-July 2021 compared with the same period of 2020. The non-energy index declined slightly by 0.2% m-o-m, with the base metals index advancing slightly while agricultural commodities eased. The non-energy index was up by 36.8% in the January-July period compared to the same period of 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In July, the Henry Hub natural gas price rose by around 17.7% m-o-m to $3.8/mmbtu. Prices strengthened as warmer-than-average weather supported consumption, while, at the same time, supplies were roughly flat during the month, resulting in limited storage builds and a widening deficit vs the five-year average. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 13 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 30 July 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 2.727 bcf, around 6.4% below the latest five-year average. At the end of June, stocks were 5.3% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe continued their ascending path in July, with the average Title Transfer Facility price up by around 21% m-o-m to $12.5/mmbtu. Average prices in the January-July period are 3.5 times higher than during the same period last year. As in previous months, prices were supported by low inventory levels, concerns about restricted supplies from Russia and continuing strong prices of carbon emission credits, which favour natural gas usage versus coal, which is also at a decades-long high. Strong demand from Asia has supported LNG differentials versus Europe, favouring exports to that region. EU inventories ended July around 57% full vs 47.5% full at the end of June, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Inventories were approximately 85% full at the end of July last year. Australian thermal coal prices rose m-o-m by 16.9% in July to $152.0/mt, its highest since mid-2008. In the January-July period, prices have been around 79% higher than the same period last year. Prices continued to be supported by warmer-than-average weather in Northeast Asia, growth in industrial activities, while some supply limitations also played a part. In main consumer China, thermal power demand rose by 10% y-o-y in June, while, at the same time, coal output declined by 5.0% y-o-y in June. According to the latest Chinese trade data, coal imports rose by 6% m-o-m in July to reach their highest level this year at 30.2 million mt. As mentioned in the previous MOMR, some restricted output across major exporters during the last few months due to extreme weather and rising prices of natural gas also contributed to a tightening of the market.

Base metals weakened at the beginning of the month as the pace of expansion of global manufacturing eased slightly for the second consecutive month, while a stronger dollar also added pressure. However, the trend reversed in the second half of the month on concerns about restricted base metal supplies from China amid severe weather and localized power cuts, while the value of the US dollar eased towards the end of the month. Average monthly copper prices declined m-o-m in July by 1.9% to average $9,450.8/mt. Average prices in the January-July period were 62.7% higher than in the same period of 2020. On the physical side, stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose by 13% to 239,650 tonnes at the end of July from 211,525 tones at the end of June, suggesting a loosening of market conditions. Moreover, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICGS), the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the first four months of the year 2021 showed a surplus of 100,000 tonnes – albeit smaller than the previous estimation for the January-March period, which showed a 150,000-tonne surplus. Iron ore prices were little changed m-o-m at a monthly average of $ 214.1/mt. Average prices in the JanuaryJuly period were twice the amount of those observed during the same period last year. Steel making activity rose at a global level by 11.6% in June 2021 compared to the same month last year, and by 14.4% in the January-June period, compared to the same period last year. Growth in Chinese output slowed to 1.5% y-o-y in June versus growth of 6.6% y-o-y in May. Iron ore imports in China declined in July by 1% and by 1.5% in the January-July period compared to the same period last year. In the group of precious metals, gold prices declined on average by 1.5% m-o-m in July amid expectations of rising real interest rates in the US. Meanwhile, silver and platinum prices declined by 4.9% and 3.3%, respectively. Investment flows into commodities Money managers’ net length positions increased in natural gas and copper but declined in crude oil and gold during the month. Despite this, investors continue to hold net long positions in the selected commodities.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 9 World Economy World Economy The global economy continues to recover, and the notion of cautious optimism, as reflected in growth numbers for both 2021 and 2022, remains a valid reference. However, numerous challenges remain that could easily dampen this momentum. In particular, COVID-19-related developments will need close monitoring over the coming months, especially when considering the usual colder weather in the northern hemisphere towards the end of the year. And while global growth levels were upgraded slightly this month, growth dynamics have become increasingly unbalanced among economies, with a large divide between OECD and non-OECD economies, except China. Those economies that have been able to gradually contain the pandemic, thanks to vaccination campaigns and other successful containment strategies, and which also have the financial capability to provide economic stimulus measures are rebounding quickly. In contrast, economies that have less access to vaccinations, apply less successful containment strategies and have only limited financial resources for fiscal and monetary stimulus are not doing as well. Recent efforts by the US administration to provide further fiscal stimulus to its economy are the latest sign of this development. Better-than-expected 2Q21 performance in the Euro-zone further lifted 2H21 momentum. The expectation of additional fiscal stimulus measures in the US – affecting 2H21 growth in and beyond the US via spillover lifting global growth – in combination with ongoing accommodative monetary policies in major economies, are all factors that have pushed up the growth forecast for both 2021 and 2022. However, lower-than-expected US 2Q21 GDP growth led to a downward revision for the country’s annual GDP growth forecast. Incorporating these changes, the 2021 global economic growth forecast was revised up to 5.6% from 5.5%. World GDP growth for 2022 was revised up to 4.2% from 4.1%. The underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 and 2022 are largely unchanged. This includes, in particular, the assumption that COVID-19 remains well contained in the advanced economies in the sense that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels and that the pandemic will also not pose a major obstacle to major emerging economies. There are, however, some significant uncertainties. The path of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the overarching factor impacting the near-term pace of the recovery, with the potential emergence of new COVID-19 variants and/or mutations posing a particular risk. Moreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates could cause severe fiscal strain. While key interest rates are assumed to stay at a very accommodative level in the near term, and although inflation scares have abated to some extent very recently, rising inflation could lead to an earlier-than-expected rise in key interest rates, an area that will also need to be closely watched.

Update on latest global developments The global economic growth momentum is continuing its dynamic, however, at differing speeds and depths regionally, leading to a variety of growth level changes this month, after 2Q21 GDP growth figures were released for the US, the Euro-zone, China and numerous other economies. Furthermore, the likelihood of further significant fiscal stimulus in the US, accompanied by ongoing monetary stimulus by the G4 central banks and a relatively more successful vaccination drive in western economies, is likely to further widen the recovery dynamic gap between OECD and non-OECD economies. China is an exception, having provided significant support to its economy and managed the pandemic’s containment well to date. This is, interestingly, in contrast to last year’s economic developments, when Asian economies were leading the recovery momentum. The rise in inflation has become another potential obstacle to the recovery over the past months. While the G4 central banks are enjoying more flexibility in responding to rising inflation, it has kept central 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Economy banks in Brazil and Russia busy lifting key interest rates. This move will make it more challenging for these two economies to fully benefit from the global rebound in the near term. Thus, the current rising tide is lifting all boats, but at a much differing pace. Those economies that are able to gradually contain the pandemic, thanks to vaccination campaigns and other successful containment strategies, and that also have the financial capabilities to provide economic stimulus measures are rebounding relatively quicker. This is in contrast to those economies that have less access to vaccinations, apply less successful containment strategies and have only limited financial resources for fiscal and monetary stimulus. Importantly, with the further easing of lockdown measures across the world, a gradual shift from manufacturing and non-contact intensive services to contact-intensive services has continued. This applies primarily to the sectors of travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure. Inflation has risen across the world over the past months for manifold reasons. There is some likelihood that the rise may be temporary, as major drivers seem to have come via re-opening effects in 1H21 and temporary supply shocks. In particular, US inflation, which is very important, was very much driven by automotive-related price rises, which were affected by a combination of two events — reopening and supply chain disruptions. It will be seen whether temporary supply shocks will be quickly overcome, as expected for semiconductors. Another uncertainty is the ongoing labour supply shortage, especially in the US, as rising wages could have a sustained effect on inflation. However, the latest numbers point to some easing of the situation. Moreover, a strong annual rise in energy and food prices drove inflation higher on an annual basis. Considering that US crude oil benchmarks turned negative in April 2020, price rises are forecast to moderate in the short term. As a very important driver, global trade continued its Graph 3 1: Global trade considerable rebound.

The ongoing recovery in the services sector, along with replenishing inventory, particularly in the US, are forecast to further lift growth towards the end of the year. Moreover, the dynamic remains well supported by the ongoing accommodative monetary policies of the G4 central banks, fiscal stimulus measures – especially in key OECD economies – and ongoing pent-up demand. The expectation of further US fiscal stimulus, in particular, is estimated at around 3 trillion USD over 10 years, which is forecast to further support US – and hence global growth – towards the end of the year. The OECD economies and China are forecast to provide the strongest support to this 2H21 growth momentum, with the contact-intensive sector contributing the most significant share to further economic improvements. The underlying assumption for short-term growth is that COVID-19 will be largely contained in 2H21 in the sense that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels and that the pandemic will also not pose a major obstacle for major emerging economies. However, the appearance of new COVID-19 variants, along with much lower vaccination rates in emerging and developing economies, may also lead to a challenging situation going forward. The key assumptions for inflation have not changed from last month. Inflation in the OECD economies is forecast to remain well-anchored in the sense that in 2021 it will not significantly exceed the 2% OECD average on an annual basis and will stand at around 4% in the US. For 2022, these levels are forecast to stand at slightly below 2% for OECD economies on average and at around 2.5% for the US. These levels would imply no unexpected interest rate hikes by G4 central banks prior to 2H23. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 11 World Economy The 2021 and 2022 forecasts have seen selective adjustments in the OECD, including a significant upward GDP growth revision for the Eurozone and the UK, but a slight downward revision for the US, all mainly due to the consideration of 2Q21 output numbers in the forecast. These revisions lifted the 2021 OECD growth forecast to 5%, compared with 4.9% the previous month. In the emerging and developing economies, the growth forecasts for Brazil and Russia were revised up, while India’s growth forecast was revised down slightly. China’s growth was unchanged. These revisions lifted the 2021 non-OECD growth forecast to 6.1% compared with 6% the previous month. For 2022, OECD growth was lifted to 3.6% from 3.2%, significantly supported by expected US fiscal stimulus and the ongoing post-COVID-19 recovery. Contrary to this development, in the relatively more advanced economies, non-OECD growth remained at 4.8%. With these base assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is forecast to stand at 1.8% q-o-q and decelerate to 0.8% q-o-q in 2Q21. Some acceleration is then forecast to materialize in 2H21, with the 3Q21 growth forecast at 1.1% q-o-q and 4Q21 growth at 1.0% q-o-q. The growth pattern in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally spread and in line with average historical patterns.

In particular, inflationary developments will need to be followed, as the danger of rising interest rates, especially in the US, and consequent repercussions for the global economy, could potentially derail the ongoing strong recovery. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments US growth has continued with a strong dynamic in 2Q21, albeit at around 2 percentage points (pp) below consensus. Preliminary 2Q21 GDP growth stood at 6.5% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). An important dampening factor came from inventory drawdowns, a factor that is, however, expected to lift 2H21 growth, given ongoing strong underlying demand. GDP growth for 1Q21 was seen to be very slightly lower as well, standing at 6.3% q-o-q SAAR, compared with 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Economy the previous estimate of 6.4% q-o-q SAAR. Alongside this short-term growth dynamic, consumer confidence developed well, as labour markets continued improving and tightness in the labour market started easing. Consumer confidence rose to 129.1 in July, compared with 128.9 in June and 120 in May, based on the index provided by the Conference Board. Importantly, it is expected that the government will provide further fiscal stimulus via various support measures at a magnitude of possibly up to $3 trillion over a period of 8 to 10 years. Considering the latest budget resolution efforts, the amount could be even more. This is expected to consist of more than $500 billion additional spending from a bipartisan infrastructure bill and an additional around $2.5 trillion from a budget reconciliation bill. In line with experience regarding past spending bills of this type, most of the money is expected to be spent in years three to eight, though the effect in the coming year is already forecast to be significant and through channel effects will also have a positive impact on global growth. Moreover, the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) also continued providing strong support, pointing to a continuation in its accommodative monetary policy. However, the topic of overheating and inflation in the US economy was recently widely discussed, as the possibility of rising interest rates to avoid overheating the economy could dampen ongoing growth. US CPI inflation stood at 5.3% y-o-y in June. However, the strongest appreciation came from the sub-sector of transportation, likely a transitory effect after the reopening of the economy and supply restrictions in the semiconductor sector. Prices in the transportation sector rose by 21.3% y-o-y. Also, the 2020 base was greatly distorted by the effects of pandemic-induced lockdowns. Last year’s April and May inflation index levels declined due to the pandemic. Moreover, with the volatile components of energy and food excluded, inflation would have stood at 4.5% y-o-y in June. The labour market regained strength again in July. Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market The unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, after rising % % slightly to 5.9% in June. 62 12 61.7 Non-farm payroll additions increased by 943,000 in 10 July, another strong lift after being upwardly revised to 938,000 in June.

Near-term expectations After somewhat weaker-than-expected 2Q21 US GDP growth, 2H21 expectations were lifted. A significant reason behind less-than-strong growth levels in 2Q21 came from a significant inventory draw-down. Given the considerable underlying momentum in the US economy, inventories will very likely be replenished in 2H21. Supply chains will need to be monitored regarding the semi-conductor shortage impacting vehicle production in 2Q21, among others. This played a role in the dynamic of inventory draw-down and if it continues, a further dampening of 2H21 growth may be possible. The labour market supply shortage, however, is expected to abate as social benefits, among other factors that may have kept potential employees from entering the labour market, have started running out. This will be supportive for the contact-intensive services sector. Expected ongoing fiscal support in 2H21 and beyond will be another supportive factor for the ongoing US recovery. In terms of quarterly growth developments, the previous 1Q21 GDP growth estimate of 6.4% q-o-q SAAR was lowered to 6.3% q-o-q SAAR, based on BEA numbers. Moreover and importantly, 2Q21 growth was reported at the lower-than-expected level of 6.5% q-o-q SAAR, compared with the Secretariat’s forecast of 9%. With the expectation of inventory restocking in 2H21 and stimulus measures of around $3 trillion to be paid out over the coming 10 years, growth levels for 2H21 and 2022 have been lifted. Assuming a ten-year period on the investment plan as indicated and an acceleration in spending towards the middle of the timespan, and by applying a multiplier of around 0.7 as a reasonable degree, a positive GDP growth impact, in addition to the US baseline forecast, would amount to 0.5 percentage points in 2022. Growth in 3Q21 is forecast to reach 8.5% q-o-q SAAR, compared with the previous estimate of 6.8% q-o-q SAAR. Growth in 4Q21 is forecast to reach 4.8% q-o-q SAAR, compared with last month’s estimate of 2.8% q-o-q SAAR in 4Q21. This could imply, however, ongoing support for inflation, despite most factors being considered temporary. Quarterly growth in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally distributed. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 13 World Economy The economy’s recovery continues to be reflected in Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and July’s PMI levels as provided by the Institute for non-manufacturing indices Supply Management (ISM).

Growth in 2022 is forecast to normalise, but will continue to be very well supported by fiscal stimulus, as well as ongoing accommodative monetary policies. These supporting factors and ongoing momentum are forecast to lift growth to a level of 4.1%, compared with 3.6% the previous month. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, remain. Another important concern is that inflation will rise at such a pace that market rates will carry an unexpected dynamic, impairing the ongoing recovery. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Euro-zone’s growth dynamic has surprised to the upside so far this year, particularly in 2Q21, when growth was stronger than expected. The recovery in contact-intensive sectors was especially strong according to a preliminary estimate by Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office. Total GDP growth was revised up for 1Q21 to stand at -1.3% q-o-q SAAR, compared to Eurostat’s previous estimate of -2.5% q-o-q SAAR. Growth in 2Q21 was reported at 8.3% – above consensus expectations and comparing with the Secretariat’s forecast of 4.5% q-o-q SAAR – with Italy and Spain especially driving the outperformance. Spain reported 2Q21 GDP growth of 11.5% q-o-q SAAR, while Italy’s 2Q21 GDP growth stood at 11.1% q-o-q SAAR. These positive developments have led to further improvements in the labour market and consumption, a trend that is forecast to continue into 2H21, albeit at a lower rate than in 2Q21. Moreover, the latest COVID-19 infection numbers in some key economies highlight the fragility of the Euro-zone’s recovery, which is very much impacted by the travel and tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors. The European Central Bank (ECB) has continued its accommodative monetary policies as inflation in the Euro-zone reached 2.4% y-o-y in July compared with 2% y-o-y in June and 1.9% y-o-y in May. When excluding the volatile items of food and energy, inflation stood at only 1.1% y-o-y in July. Positively, lending to the private sector by monetary financial institutions recovered slightly as well, rising to 2.5% y-o-y in June, from 2.2% y-o-y in May. However, almost one-third of lending activity ends up in the real estate sector, while lending to non-financial corporations rose by just 0.6% y-o-y in both June and May, a strong slowdown from 1.8% y-o-y in April. 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Economy The labour market has continued to improve Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales according to the latest numbers from Eurostat — the % change y-o-y unemployment rate stood at 7.7% y-o-y in June, down 30 from 8% in May and 8.1% in April. 20 Retail sales in value terms have risen and remained high, with growth of 6.6% y-o-y in June, after rising 10 10.2% y-o-y in May, both on a seasonally adjusted 6.6 basis.

Near-term expectations Following strong growth in 1H21 that was driven by pent-up demand after the end of lockdown measures and an apparent recovery in contact-intensive sectors, growth in 2H21 will remain well supported, but at a slightly lower average level. This forecast, for both 2021 and 2022, is also based on the assumption that COVID-19 containment in 2H21 will support the recovery and not derail the economy. However, recent rises in infections in some parts of the Euro-zone have highlighted the ongoing challenges connected to the pandemic. It remains to be seen whether vaccination rates will achieve sufficient levels towards the autumn and winter to prevent the further spread of the new – and apparently more contagious – variants. As a result, significant uncertainty prevails. Fiscal stimulus and the ongoing accommodative monetary policy by the ECB are counterbalancing the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. GDP growth in 2H21 is forecast to slow down on a quarterly basis after reported growth of 1.3% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q21 and 8.3% in 2Q21. GDP growth in 3Q21 is anticipated to reach 7.8% q-o-q SAAR. While this is slightly below the 2Q21 level, it compares with a forecast of 10.8% q-o-q SAAR in the previous month. In 4Q21, growth is forecast at 3.2% q-o-q SAAR, compared with a growth forecast of 5.7% q-o-q SAAR in the previous month. Consequently, quarterly growth could peak in 2Q21. The July PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed to Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs an ongoing improvement in the manufacturing and Index services sectors. Momentum in the services sector is 70 forecast to gain significant pace in the coming months, 62.8 if the COVID-19 situation does not worsen. The PMI 59.8 60 for services, the largest sector in the Euro-zone, rose to 59.8 in July from 58.3 in June and 55.2 in May. The manufacturing PMI retracted only slightly to 62.8 in 50 July, compared with 63.4 in June and 63.1 in May.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 15 World Economy OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Japan’s economy continues to be supported by government-led stimulus in general and external trade. However, domestic demand remains a weak spot amid the numerous lockdown measures that have been implemented since the beginning of the year. Reported COVID-19 infections have risen significantly in recent weeks, with a majority of the newly infected in the younger population. Amid the considerable rise in hospitalisation rates, the government had to tighten conditions for COVID-19 hospitalisation. With relatively unchanged mobility trends, it remains to be seen how the COVID-19 situation will develop, but there is certainly some possibility that it could worsen. The rise in infections comes despite all the newly implemented or extended emergency measures announced by the government. These state of emergency declarations are mostly voluntary, and cover 37% of the population, according to Reuters. While mobility is holding up well, the services sector remains largely impacted by social-distancing measures as reflected in the most recent business and consumer indices. Manufacturing is performing relatively better, supported by external trade. While indicators point to an ongoing improvement in the economy, supported mainly by the industrial sector, the pandemic is preventing the country’s full growth potential from unfolding. Growth in industrial production (IP) was very positive again in June on a yearly basis, while the numbers continue to be distorted by the sharp decline last year. June’s growth stood at 21.2% y-o-y, compared with 19.8% y-o-y in May and 14.6% y-o-y in April. On a monthly basis, IP increased by 6.1% in June on a seasonally adjusted basis. Growth in exports continued to stage a strong Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports recovery as well, rising by 48.6% y-o-y, after reaching % change y-o-y 49.6% y-o-y in May and 38% y-o-y in April on a 60 non-seasonally adjusted basis.

Near-term expectations Japan’s economy remains very much impacted by COVID-19-related developments. While the industrial sector of the economy is doing well, very much supported by exports, domestic demand could provide further upside, if picking up in the coming months. In this respect it remains to be seen how COVID-19 will develop in the country and also how some of the political uncertainties, with likely upcoming elections in autumn, will turn out. With these somewhat unclear signals, the GDP growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 remain unchanged and the economic situation will be monitored closely over the coming weeks to see which direction the GDP growth dynamic will take. As reported by Japan’s statistical office 1Q21 GDP declined by 3.9% q-o-q SAAR. Given the ongoing lockdown measures in 2Q21, however, growth is forecast at only 0.4% q-o-q SAAR in this quarter. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 should then pick up, with the global economy’s recovery gaining pace and domestic demand in Japan expected to rise further. Hence, growth is forecast at 7% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21 before slowing somewhat to reach 5% in 4Q21. However, pandemic-related uncertainties loom large. 16 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Economy The impact of the ongoing lockdowns is also reflected Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs in the latest PMIs from July, especially in the services Index sector, which remains below the growth-indicating 55 level of 50.

Some of the 2H21 momentum is forecast to carry over into 2022, when GDP growth is anticipated to normalise towards pre-pandemic levels.

Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s real GDP grew by 7.9% y-o-y in 2Q21, down from record growth of 18.3% in 1Q21. The slowdown in recovery momentum was mainly caused by a slowdown in factory activity, higher costs for raw materials, along with COVID-19 outbreaks in some regions. In 1H21, China’s economy expanded by 12.7% amid a low base effect from last year's coronavirus-triggered slump. Recent major economic indicators continued to grow at a slow pace amid the newest COVID-19 outbreak and extreme weather conditions.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 17 World Economy On external demand, China's trade surplus expanded to $56.6 billion in July, compared with a surplus of $60.5 billion in July the previous year. This was the largest trade surplus since January 2021 amid the recovery in global demand and high commodity prices. Exports rose by 19.3% y-o-y to $282.7 billion, while imports jumped 28.1% y-o-y to $226.1 billion. However, the unforeseen growth in external demand might slow if global consumption moves primarily towards service demand. The country’s trade surplus with the US increased to $35.4 billion in July from $32.6 billion in June. China's annual inflation rate dropped slightly to 1.0% y-o-y in July from 1.1% y-o-y in the previous month, amid a steeper decline in food costs. Meanwhile, producer prices rose to 9.0% y-o-y in July, after seeing a 8.8% y-o-y gain in June. On the policy front, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) cut the amount of cash most banks must hold in reserve in order to boost lending, as economic growth began to falter. The PBoC trimmed the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 pp for most banks, freeing up about 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) of long-term liquidity for the economy. Near-term expectations GDP growth in 2Q21 of 7.9% y-o-y indicates a solid increase of 2.4% q-o-q. These figures confirm the stable economic recovery for China and the ease at which the country will achieve its official 6% growth target for 2021. However, China has recently been hit by a renewed COVID-19 variant outbreak, combined with extreme weather conditions, which may weigh on economic activities, particularly from the supply side.

Indeed, current indicators suggest that 2Q21 real GDP might have returned to pre-pandemic levels faster than the rest of Latin America. Moreover, the vaccination rate keeps increasing, which has noticeably helped in tempering the latest wave of COVID-19 fatalities. 20 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Economy Industrial production rose 12% y-o-y in the month of June compared with 24% y-o-y the previous month. The consumer confidence index jumped to 80.3% in June from 76.5% in May. Similarly, retail sales rose 16% in May over the same month in 2020. Pressure on the labour market continued to marginally decline. The most recent available unemployment data for May show that the jobless rate was 14.6%, 0.1 pp less than April’s rate. However, the three-month moving average in March–May hit a record high of 14.6% compared with the three-month moving average from January–April. High unemployment rates caused by the re-imposition of lockdowns across the country and the cancellation of Carnival amid the resurgence of COVID-19 infections affected 1H21.

However, fiscal policy is anticipated to be highly contractionary in the short and medium term to offset massive spending in 2020. Near-term expectations In 1H21, the economy of Brazil appeared to be back to pre-pandemic levels, becoming more resilient than expected, despite the recent rise in COVID-19 infections. Increasing vaccination rates should support the reopening of the economy more fully. The recent PMI reading mirrored this boost in Graph 3 17: Brazil’s PMIs economic activity. The manufacturing PMI rose to Index 56.7 in July from 56.4 in June, with the slight pick-up 70 in the reading marking the sharpest growth in the sector since February and bringing it above the longterm average recorded by IHS Markit. 60 56.7 Likewise, the services PMI reading for July rose to 54.4 54.4 from 53.9 in June, recording the second month 50 of expansion in the sector amid improvements in demand conditions driven by the quick accumulation 40 of service business volumes.

Moreover, fiscal risks might return to the fore in the near future, as the new round of “corona vouchers” will end this year. Additionally, the government might consider boosting its social spending to support the current administration in the upcoming October 2022 presidential election. The end of the voucher might impact household short-term spending, while boosting social spending might weakening the Brazilian real, negatively affecting the economy. Overall, the near-term outlook for Brazil’s economy is quite positive, supported by hopes of greater vaccine availability and the potential retreat of COVID-19.

According to provisional data from the South African Revenue Service, 2Q21 exports climbed by 81.3% y-o-y to R487bn (US$34.4bn), while imports surged by 34.7% to R328bn. The trade balance stands at a quarterly surplus of R159bn, which is an all-time high record. Aside from the external demand surge, the riots and looting that took place in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, along with the fourth COVID-19 wave, may threaten the country’s positive economic recovery. Currently, there is a gradual easing of strict containment measures, which were imposed for four weeks. The impact on the recovery has been highly pronounced in both the labour market and overall price levels. Recent labour market data suggest that unemployment rose to 32.6% in 1Q21, the highest rate since comparable data started to be released in 2008. The expanded definition of unemployment rose to 43.2% in 1Q21, up from 42.6% in 4Q20. Moreover, the unemployment rate among job-seekers between 15 and 24 years hit a record high of 63.3%. Recent consumer price levels slightly eased to 5% in June from 5.2% y-o-y in May, though this is still above the 4.5% midpoint of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range of 3-6%. Part of the higher price pressure is due to last year's low base. However, the core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items, surged to 3.2% in June, the highest rate since January 2021. Near-term expectations The impact of the last containment measures to manage COVID-19 cases and the political tension following recent riots might erase the positive economic gains accumulated in 1H21. However, the gradual lifting of restrictions, along with the external demand boom, may keep the recovery on track. At present, the RMB/BER business confidence index increased in 2Q21 to well above pre-pandemic levels to 50 from 35 in 1Q21, as confidence rebounded sharply in manufacturing, the retail trade and the motor industry. In contrast, South Africa's Absa manufacturing PMI dropped sharply to 43.5 in July from 57.4 in June, marking the sharpest deterioration in business conditions since May of 2020.

Industrial production advanced for the fourth month in a row in June to 10.4% y-o-y following a revised figure of 12.3% y-o-y in May. Retail sales grew as well, by 10.9% y-o-y, following a 27.2% jump the previous month. Additionally, car sales edged up 29% y-o-y in June. Inflationary pressures continued to weigh on the Graph 3 18: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate recovery, despite that fact that July’s inflation rate % stood at 6.5%, unchanged from last month.

But for now, vaccination programmes are gaining momentum amid increased governmental pressure on the population to get vaccinated, adding further growth potential for the Russian economy. OPEC Member Countries Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s real GDP expanded by 1.5% y-o-y in 2Q21, following a 3% contraction in 1Q21. This was the first economic expansion since 2Q19. Non-oil economic activities advanced by 10.1% y-o-y. On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the economy advanced by 1.1%. In July, the non-oil manufacturing PMI dropped to 55.8 from 56.4 in June, recording the lowest index since April 2021 amid concerns over the path of the global pandemic. Nevertheless, it still points to a good growth in the manufacturing sector over the short term. Nigeria July PMI readings continued to be above the threshold level of 50 points for the second month in a row in Nigeria, pointing to an improvement in business conditions and a recovery in non-oil activities. In July, the Stanbic IBTC Bank of Nigeria PMI rose to 55.4, up from 53.6 in June. This was the strongest reading since January 2020, amid faster growth in non-oil output, new orders, purchases and higher employment. The average reading for 2Q21 also came in at 53.6, which is higher than the 1Q21 average of 51.9. Although there is optimism about output prospects going forward, uncertainties remain high due to the Delta variant. Additionally, price pressures increased as the CPI reached 17.8% y-o-y in July, though it has slightly eased from the 17.9% y-o-y seen in June. CPI edged up on a monthly basis by 1.1%, following 1.0% the previous month. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) The IHS Markit United Arab Emirates PMI edged up to 54 in July from 52.2 in June, marking the highest reading since July 2019. The current PMI increase reflected the ongoing demand rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, business conditions in the United Arab Emirates improved most since 2019 as pandemic restrictions eased. Nevertheless, lockdown measures in other parts of the world impacted external demand in July, as firms turned to local clients for support. However, the growth outlook remained high, as the postponed Expo 2020 should strengthen economic conditions in the short term.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 25 World Oil Demand World Oil Demand World oil demand growth in 2021 remains unchanged from last month’s report. This is despite the upward revision to GDP growth, as the rising economic recovery is projected to take place mainly in non-oilintensive sectors. Total global oil demand is estimated to increase by around 6.0 mb/d to 96.6 mb/d. However, some revisions were taken into account in 1Q21 due to slower-than-anticipated demand in OECD Americas and offset by better-than-expected data from non-OECD countries in 2Q21. In the OECD, oil demand is expected to increase by 2.6 mb/d, around 0.1 mb/d lower than last month’s estimation, and reach 44.6 mb/d. Weaker-than-anticipated demand for gasoline due to mobility limitations in 1Q21 affected overall demand negatively. Similarly, a slower recovery in a number of countries in OECD Asia Pacific due to COVID-19 containment measures reduced demand for transportation fuels. In the non-OECD, oil demand is expected to increase by 3.4 mb/d, some 0.1 mb/d higher than last month’s report, to reach 51.9 mb/d. Better-than-expected 2Q21 data from the Middle East and Africa supported by recovery in industrial fuels encouraged this upward revision. On the other hand, sluggish mobility data in India necessitated some downward revision to 2Q21 figures, slightly counterbalancing the upward revisions in the other regions. In 2022, world oil demand is projected to increase by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y, also unchanged from last month’s expectations, as the upward revision to 2022 GDP is assumed to take place mostly in non-oil intensive sectors. Total world oil demand is projected to surpass 100 mb/d in 2H22 and reach 99.9 mb/d on average for 2022. Economic growth is forecast to pick up on the back of massive stimulus packages. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be under control, supported by vaccination programmes and improved treatment, allowing for steadily rising oil demand in both the OECD and non-OECD. In the OECD, oil demand for next year is estimated to increase by 1.5 mb/d, led by OECD Americas, while OECD Europe and Asia Pacific are projected to rise but remain below 2019 consumption levels. Gasoline, diesel and light distillates are expected to lead oil demand growth in 2022 as miles travelled gradually recover, the industrial sector picks up steam, and amid the ramping up and commissioning of ethane crackers. In the non-OECD, oil demand is anticipated to grow by 1.8 mb/d, led by China, Other Asia and India. However, demand in China and India are projected to outstrip pre-COVID-19 levels, supported by a healthy rise in demand for transportation and industrial fuels. Demand in Other Asia, Latin America and the Middle East is anticipated to be strong, especially in Other Asia, supported by increases in mobility and progressing industrial sector.

OECD OECD Americas Update on the latest developments The latest available oil demand data in OECD Graph 4 1: OECD Americas oil demand, y-o-y Americas implies an increase of 3.4 mb/d y-o-y in change May, following an increase of 5.3 mb/d y-o-y in April. mb/d More than 65% of this increase stems from a rebound in demand for road transportation fuels, particularly 6 gasoline, while jet fuel demand continued to rise and 4 grew by 0.8 mb/d y-o-y, yet remained approximately 1.8 2 1.0 30% lower than pre-COVID-19 levels. Gasoline demand posted substantial gains of 2.2 mb/d y-o-y for 0 the third month in a row and in line with a rebound in -2 travel following a historic drop in May 2020. Demand for transportation fuels, as well as total petroleum -4 -3.1 product demand, remained below May 2019 levels by -6 almost 2.0 mb/d. On top of the low May 2020 baseline, 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year all countries in the region posted solid gains as demand rebounded the most in the US, followed by 2020 2021* 2022* Canada, Mexico and Chile. Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. The latest available US monthly data for May implies US oil demand rose by approximately 4.0 mb/d y-o-y, making up 93% of the losses incurred during the historic drop in May 2020, but remained almost 1.4 mb/d lower than May 2019. Gasoline and jet kerosene requirements contributed the most to the increase, with gasoline gaining 1.9 mb/d y-o-y and jet/kerosene rising by 0.7 mb/d y-o-y in May 2021. Both fuels fell sharply in May 2020, by 2.3 mb/d and 1.2 mb/d y-o-y, respectively. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHA), vehicle miles of travel in the US increased by 28.7% y-o-y in May this year after rising by 54.9% y-o-y in April. In May 2020, the indicator fell by more than 25% y-o-y. Light vehicle retail sales, as reported by Autodata and Haver Analytics, were at 17.2 million units according to seasonally adjusted annual rates (SAAR), compared with 18.8 million units in April. Historical figures show total sales of 12.1 million units in May 2020 and 17.4 million units in April 2019. Industrial production, a leading indicator for industrial fuel demand, rose by 16.2% y-o-y in May after increasing by 17.6% y-o-y in April. The indicator remained flat in May 2019, according to Federal Reserve Board data. Diesel demand was higher by 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in May 2021 following OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 27 World Oil Demand an increase of 0.5 mb/d in April. Preliminary data for June, based on weekly input, indicates the continuation of a recovery in transportation fuel performance, with both gasoline and jet kerosene increasing by more than 1.6 mb/d y-o-y collectively. Diesel is foreseen to increase by 0.4 mb/d y-o-y in June 2021.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Near-term expectations Careful optimism dominates the short-term future demand in the region. The vaccination rollout and the overall management of the COVID-19 pandemic underlie the optimism, together with massive stimulus programmes, high household savings, improvements in employment rates and a reduction or complete withdrawal of COVID-19 measures. These factors support a positive outlook for oil demand during the 2H21. At the same time, the outlook could remain challenged by COVID-19 developments, particularly during the emergence of colder weather in the 4Q21, and the appearance of new variants and possible government countermeasures. Transportation fuel demand correlates strongly with the overall economy and in particular with unemployment rates and fuel retail prices. While 3Q21 appears to be promising in terms of travel activities, risks from the impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour, as well as the effectiveness of vaccination programmes, are to be monitored closely going forward. In 2022, OECD Americas oil demand is forecasted to increase by around 1.0 mb/d y-o-y with US oil demand accounting for more than 0.8 mb/d y-o-y. Forecasted demand growth is supported by solid economic performance. The petrochemical and transportation sectors will require more oil during 2022. Gasoline demand will be backed by improved employment rates and increases in vehicle sales, despite the continuous penetration of alternative fuel vehicles. Expansion in the petrochemical industry and consequently healthy petrochemical margins will provide support to light distillates in 2022. On the other hand, challenges remain, such as reduced business travel, a continuation in fuel substitution programmes, and fuel efficiency gains. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments OECD Europe oil demand rose by a strong 1.8 mb/d Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y in May, following an increase of more than 1.9 change mb/d y-o-y in April. Demand for most petroleum mb/d product categories posted large y-o-y gains, as a 2 result of the low historical baseline and the removal of 1 0.6 restrictions in almost all countries in the region amid 0.4 increasing vaccination rates and falling COVID-19 0 infection cases. The strongest gains were for -1 gasoline, diesel, jet/kerosene and light distillates.

Lower numbers of COVID-19 cases, in combination with substantial improvements in vaccine rollouts, led governments to remove strict containment measures and policies that hindered business and leisure travel. 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 4: Europe’s Big 4* oil demand, mb/d Change May 21/May 20 By product May 20 May 21 Growth % LPG 0.33 0.45 0.12 35.4 Naphtha 0.51 0.54 0.03 6.7 Gasoline 0.75 1.09 0.34 44.9 Jet/kerosene 0.26 0.33 0.07 26.3 Diesel 2.65 2.80 0.15 5.8 Fuel oil 0.14 0.19 0.06 41.2 Other products 0.39 0.48 0.09 23.9 Total 5.02 5.88 0.86 17.1 Note: * Germany, France, Italy and the UK.

Demand in the UK grew the most, by 0.5 mb/d, followed by Italy, 0.3 mb/d, and France, 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y. In Germany, as many COVID-19 measures remained in place during May 2021, oil demand fell by almost 0.2 mb/d y-o-y. Substantial oil demand gains were also observed in all other regional countries, coupled with decreasing stringency indexes. Travelling across borders and within the region became less restrictive both on the road as well as in the air, sharply increasing leisure activities. The industrial production index, which excludes construction, rose sharply as compared to the same month in 2020, as reported by Eurostat and Haver Analytics. New passenger car registrations rose almost 53% y-o-y, following a huge 264% y-o-y increase in April. Unemployment rates fell m-o-m, yet rose y-o-y. Near-term expectations The outlook for 2021 remains resilient, despite COVID-19-related containment efforts during the first four months of the year and as challenges in vaccination rollouts inevitably implied the re-introduction of stringent measures. However, vaccination rates have improved rapidly and warmer weather has favoured efforts to control the pandemic. These developments and the improved coordination among the region’s countries support careful optimism in the region’s 2021 oil demand outlook, resulting from growing economic activity and a successful COVID-19 containment effort. The current outlook assumes that herd immunity will most likely be achieved during 4Q21. Fuel efficiency gains, reduced international travel, teleworking enhancements and limitations in petroleum product demand will partly remain and cap oil demand going forward. In 2022, OECD Europe oil demand is expected to rise by around 0.4 mb/d. Developments in the economy, along with containment of COVID-19, are the main assumptions for OECD Europe oil demand growth in 2022. These are supported by improvements in mobility as well as positive developments in the industrial and construction sectors. Downside risks are mostly related to the appearance of resilient COVID-19 variants, economic uncertainty, high debt levels and budgetary constraints, as well as stringent policies capping oil usage. OECD Europe oil demand will remain therefore below 2019 levels. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments OECD Asia Pacific oil demand continued to improve Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y and grew by 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in May, through this was change less than the corresponding increase recorded in April mb/d at 0.6 mb/d.

Sources: JODI, METI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Efficient containment measures in South Korea seemed to have curbed a further increase in COVID-19 cases. Consequently, transportation fuel demand going further into 2021 is expected to recover, as are requirements for industrial fuels and petrochemical feedstock. Overall demand in 2021 is projected to rebound in the region, mainly in 2H21, on the back of a recovery in economic activities. Petrochemical feedstock consumption remains one of the main contributors to oil demand growth in 2021 while jet/kerosene demand is projected to continue lagging 2019 levels as international business and leisure travel are anticipated to remain under pressure. In 2022, OECD Asia Pacific oil demand is expected to increase by 0.2 mb/d, under assumptions of expanding GDP and low impact from COVID-19-related challenges on transportation fuel demand. Herd immunity is anticipated to reach desired targets in 2022 amid vaccination efforts. Gasoline will be the petroleum product category to increase the most, followed by industrial diesel, as well as light distillate petrochemical feedstock. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s oil demand data for June shows growth of Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change more than 0.4 mb/d y-o-y compared to around mb/d 1.0 mb/d y-o-y in May.

Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand is expected to grow solidly in 2021, mainly driven by steady economic activity and a low baseline. Economic sectors are expected to show healthy performance for the remainder of the current year, led by the transportation, petrochemical and industrial sectors. Gasoline demand is projected to continue growing but might face some challenges amid sluggish vehicle sales and slower mobility due to the lack of national breaks. Diesel consumption is projected to grow in the reminder of the year on the back of steady improvements in the industrial, construction and agricultural sectors. LPG and naphtha will record positive gains going forward due to healthy petrochemical margins and recent capacity development. In 2022, China’s oil demand is expected to rise by 0.5 mb/d with total demand to surpass 2019 levels on the basis of economic growth forecasts. Oil demand for the transportation and industrial sectors is expected to grow, buoyed by a firm increase in mobility, rising passenger car sales and a healthy industrial sector. Gasoline is anticipated to rise the most then diesel. Petrochemical end-use consumption is similarly estimated to support demand for light distillates. India Update on the latest developments India’s oil demand increased marginally in June, Graph 4 5: India’s oil demand, y-o-y change with data showing a rise of around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y after mb/d marginally dropping in May due to the prevalence of 1.0 the COVID-19 Delta variant. 0.5 0.5 Oil demand declined by 0.2 mb/d when compared to 0.3 June 2019, largely resulting from weaknesses in 0.0 diesel and transportation fuels.

According to Google maps and Apple’s mobility index, mobility picked up pace in June and reached 71% of pre-pandemic levels, compared with 52% during the month of May. Looking at diesel, slower construction and trucking activities together with a drop in India’s manufacturing PMI, which fell into the contraction zone for the first time since July 2020, weighed on diesel demand in June. Diesel demand was marginally lower in June compared with some growth in May, although consumption remained largely below pre-COVID-19 levels by around 0.3 mb/d compared to June 2019. Jet/kerosene demand continued to be impacted by fewer international flights, thus reducing jet fuel demand, as well as the substitution with LPG for kerosene in the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 31 World Oil Demand residential sector. Jet/kerosene increased only marginally in June despite the significant decline in the baseline and when compared to June 2019, jet/kerosene demand was lower by more than 0.1 mb/d.

Near-term expectations Going forward, economic activity is projected to continue to recover in 2H21 and as such demand for petroleum products is expected to improve. However, uncertainty remains high mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the pace of vaccination efforts across the country. Additionally, high retail prices add to the uncertainties going forward. Oil consumption is projected to pick up pace over the short term, supported by the low baseline and uptick in diesel demand in a number of sectors, including construction and agriculture. The recovery in transportation fuels is anticipated to depend on pandemic developments and the government’s countermeasures. Together with the 2020 baseline decline, oil demand is projected to show healthy growth in 2021. Demand for transportation fuel will lead product demand, followed by middle distillates with most of the gains appearing in 2H21. In 2022, similar to last month’s expectations, oil demand is anticipated to increase by around 0.3 mb/d with total volumes expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels on an annualized basis. COVID-19 containment measures are projected be aided by the acceleration in vaccination efforts, natural immunity and better treatments for COVID-19. The economic outlook remains as highlighted last month, showing an increase in GDP of around 6.8%. From the products side, gasoline is projected to lead oil demand growth in 2022, supported by increasing mobility, a pickup in two-wheeler sales compared to the current year, and overall economic developments. Diesel is assumed to be supported by healthy industrial, construction and agricultural activities in 2022.

That is higher than the 83% recoded in April. On the other hand, the aviation sector in Latin America remained around 50% below pre-crisis levels, thus weighing on jet fuel recovery. Jet fuel demand increased marginally in May following a small increase in April. Near-term expectations Positive PMI data for Brazil and further improvements in mobility support encouraging prospects for oil demand in June. Going forward, the oil demand forecast for 2H21 remains supported by the low baseline and positive economic outlook. However, risks remain linked to COVID-19 and the subsequent containment measures. Latin America’s 2021 oil demand outlook remains the same as last month’s MOMR, with no major revisions in 2021 or 2022 oil demand projections. Risks appear to be slightly tilted to the downside in light of developments on the COVID-19 front and vaccinations efforts. On the other hand, further positive economic developments resulting from fiscal stimulus programmes is anticipated to offset many of the negative risks. In 2022, Latin America’s oil demand is anticipated to rise by 0.2 mb/d but will still be below 2019 levels. The rise in oil demand will be largely linked to positive economic outlook, which will support industrial fuel demand led by diesel. The outlook for growth sees Brazil taking the lead, followed by Argentina. In terms of fuel, transportation fuels are expected to grow the most in 2022, supported by the continued recovery in the transportation sector as containment measures for COVID-19 are relaxed and as the overall economy gains momentum. Moreover, construction and industrial fuels are also anticipated to gain pace in 2022. Middle East Update on the latest developments Following strong oil demand growth in April, Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change Middle East oil demand posted gains of 1.1 mb/d mb/d y-o-y in May, making up all the losses incurred in May 1.0 2020 and were on par with pre-COVID-19 levels. Transportation fuel led the recovery and posted solid 0.5 0.4 y-o-y gains, but remained below pre-COVID-19 0.3 levels. Heavy distillates performed steadily both y-o-y 0.0 and also when compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. Fuel oil and the “other product’ category, which also includes crude oil for power generation, increased by -0.5 nearly 0.1 mb/d y-o-y and were more than 0.2 mb/d -0.7 above May 2019.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 33 World Oil Demand In June, oil demand in Saudi Arabia continued to increase compared to the same last year, adding 0.2 mb/d to average 2.3 mb/d, supported by gasoline, which increased by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. While diesel and fuel oil decreased y-o-y by 0.01 mb/d and 0.03 mb/d, respectively. The industrial production index, as reported by the General Authority for Statistics and Haver Analytics, rose to 110.2 in June (reference 2010=100) from 106.3 in May.

Sources: JODI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand is anticipated to continue to recover and show steady gains during 2H21. This will depend to a certain degree on further developments in COVID-19 containment measures, which are assumed to be very limited and any risks of increases in COVID-19 cases are muted and well controlled due to the high vaccination rate in certain region. The continued improvement in mobility supported by the summer driving season and holiday trips are projected to support the gasoline recovery process in 3Q21 with a limited contribution from the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia. The resumption of international flights in most countries in the region is assumed to support jet fuel demand through the end of 2021, but jet fuel demand is projected to remain well below pre-COVID-19 levels. In 2022, oil demand in the Middle East is projected to increase by 0.3 mb/d, supported by the steady economic outlook. Transportation fuel, led by gasoline and on road diesel, as well as light distillates for petrochemical usage and construction fuels are projected to lead oil demand growth in 2022. Saudi Arabia is expected to lead the oil demand increase in the region due to steady economic expectations, controlled COVID-19 cases and its healthy petrochemical sector. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 (including processing gains) was revised up by 0.27 mb/d from the previous assessment. The revisions are mainly due to the incorporation of the latest production adjustment decisions of the non-OPEC countries participating in the DoC, which have now been considered, following the successful conclusion of the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 18 July 2021. Annual growth is now forecast at 1.1 mb/d y-o-y, to reach 64.0 mb/d, but still far from the highest level of non-OPEC supply of 66.9 mb/d in 1Q20 – before the oil market turmoil due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In the US, operators have remained highly disciplined in 2020-2021. Nevertheless, rig count continue to rise, more wells are being fracked and more frac crews are deployed, as firms are again flush with free cash flow. The US liquids supply forecast has been revised up by 65 tb/d, owing to higherthan-anticipated production in April and May of 2Q21, and is forecast to grow by 0.12 mb/d y-o-y. Moreover, top European energy companies signalled confidence in a lasting recovery from the pandemic by drawing on higher oil prices to boost shareholder returns and reassure investors as they roll out risky climate strategies. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, Russia, China, the US, Norway and Brazil, while output is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Indonesia and Egypt. The non-OPEC supply forecast for 2022 has been revised up by 0.84 mb/d, also reflecting the latest DoC production adjustment decision, and is now expected to grow by 2.9 mb/d to average 66.9 mb/d (including a recovery of 0.11 mb/d in processing gains). Including the expected growth of OPEC NGLs, liquids supply is forecast to grow by 3.1 mb/d. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are Russia (1.0 mb/d) and the US (0.78 mb/d), followed by Brazil, Norway, Canada, Kazakhstan, Guyana and other countries in the DoC. Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding the financial and operational aspects of US production remains high. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 is estimated to grow by 0.12 mb/d to average 5.17 mb/d. For 2022, it is forecast to grow by 0.13 mb/d to average 5.29 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in July increased by 0.64 mb/d m-o-m to average 26.66 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids production in July, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have increased by 0.33 mb/d m-o-m to average 69.0 mb/d, up by 2.45 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply increased by 0.97 mb/d m-o-m to average 95.69 mb/d, up by 5.79 mb/d y-o-y.

Indeed, tight crude production alone is forecast to grow by 0.56 mb/d to average 11.77 mb/d, while output in the GoM is expected to be fully offset by a drop in conventional crude production. Five projects, including Argos (Mad Dog Phase 2) with expected peak production of 120 tb/d, Power Nap, Manuel, Samurai and Khaleesi are projected to produce a total of around 45 tb/d in 2022, the first year of production. The US crude oil production exit rate in 2022 is expected to be not less than 12.1 mb/d. In contrast, US NGLs production is expected to grow by a slight 0.14 mb/d in 2021 compared with the remarkable growth of 0.34 mb/d in 2020, to average 5.3 mb/d. NGLs production, mainly from unconventional sources (around 85%), is forecast to grow to 5.46 mb/d in 2022, with the expectation of ethane rejection in gas plants remaining at almost the same level as in 2021. US biofuels and other non-conventional liquids production is forecast to recover by 0.05 mb/d in 2021 to average 1.20 mb/d and see further recovery in 2022, rising by 0.07 mb/d to average 1.27 mb/d. Regarding oil transportation, the disputed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Nebraska was cancelled after the Biden administration revoked the previous administration’s approval. Other pipelines designed to bring Canadian and/or tight oil from the Bakken in North Dakota south to refining hubs, notably including the Line 3 and Dakota Access pipelines, also remain uncertain.

Relationship between drilling & completion activities and DUCs Drilling activity has increased modestly and the US oil rig count rose by 180 rigs y-o-y to 385 in the last week of July, of which 124 were added in the Permian Basin to total 243, and the rest were added in other key regions. Completions experienced stronger growth, which led to a further drawdown in the drilled but uncompleted (DUC) inventory since June 2020. Unconventional horizontal completion activity in the US onshore increased by 11% in 2Q21 q-o-q, up by 81% y-o-y. Completed lateral footage trends in horizontal wells in 2Q21 also show an increase of 14% q-o-q, which is higher by 84% y-o-y. In May, US tight oil production increased in the Permian by 37 tb/d, while production in other shale plays declined, which led to flat output of 7.12 mb/d compared with April. Given the current drilling activity trend, it is expected that the DUCs inventories will decline by year’s end. As a result, shale operators will need to finish another 617 uncompleted wells to 40 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Oil Supply compensate for the base decline and move forward with mild growth, according to a Rystad Energy analysis in July 2021.

However, production from Johan Sverdrup phase-1, Equinor’s flagship 2.7 billion barrel project, where capacity reached 535 tb/d in May following upgrades to water injection facilities, is expected to remain steady by the end of the year. Moreover, production is expected to reach 53 tb/d at a new project for 2021, Martin Linge. Production from the Yme field is also expected to come on stream during 2H21. For 2022, Norwegian liquids production is expected to grow by 0.17 mb/d to average 2.27 mb/d, through startups of new offshore projects such as Nova, Hod (redevelopment), Njord Future, Bauge and Fenja-phase 1 is anticipated. Moreover, Johan Sverdrup phase-2 is expected to come on stream in late 2022, and will lift Norwegian crude oil production to more than 2 mb/d. It is worth noting that Norway’s tax incentives initiated last year in response to the pandemic have led to increased investment in oil and gas projects.

Latin America Latin America’s total liquids supply in June remained unchanged m-o-m to average 5.97 mb/d. Oil output increases in Colombia and Guyana were offset by a decline in Brazilian production. Liquids output was down by 0.12 mb/d y-o-y. For 2021, liquids production has been revised down by 11 tb/d m-o-m and is projected to grow by 0.14 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.18 mb/d. Oil production in Brazil, Guyana, Ecuador, Argentina and Peru is forecast to increase, while declines are expected in Colombia and other countries in the region. Production in Ecuador is projected to recover from outages experienced in 2020 and grow by 0.03 mb/d to average 0.52 mb/d. Following a national strike and protests across Colombia, crude oil production was affected through May and June that led to a lower production in 2Q21 by 0.02 mb/d compared with 1Q21 to average 0.75 mb/d. Preliminary production data in July indicates that output has returned to the April level. Oil production is likely to decline in Colombia by 0.03 mb/d, which has been revised down by 0.05 mb/d m-o-m. Oil production in the Liza Phase 1 in Guyana through the FPSO vessel Liza Destiny is currently about 120 tb/d, and is expected to average 0.12 mb/d in 2021, with y-o-y growth of 0.04 mb/d. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 45 World Oil Supply In Argentina, oil production is forecast to grow by 0.02 mb/d to average 0.68 mb/d. This should come mainly in the form of tight crude from Vaca Muerta, which is expected to grow by 29 tb/d in 2021 to average 137 tb/d. However, possible higher natural declines in mature fields may impact anticipated overall growth for the year. For 2022, Latin America’s total liquids supply forecast is projected to grow by 0.33 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.52 mb/d. One of the key drivers is Brazil, with expected growth of 0.24 mb/d, including biofuels, to average 3.99 mb/d. Guyana would be the second country in the region experiencing growth next year, with output rising by 0.09 mb/d, through the start-up of Liza Phase 2, which remains on target for early 2022. The FPSO Liza Unity, with a production capacity of about 220 tb/d of oil, is expected to sail from Singapore to Guyana in late August 2021. Oil production in other countries in the region will decline or see only minor growth. Brazil Following a decline of 0.04 mb/d in May m-o-m, Brazil’s crude oil output in June fell by 0.03 mb/d m-o-m to average 2.90 mb/d on the back of outages at the Jubarte, Tartaruga Verde and Atlanta fields. Crude oil output averaged 2.89 mb/d in 1Q21, down 0.08 mb/d y-o-y. In June, total liquids production was pegged at an average of 3.58 mb/d, including biofuels and NGLs, down by 0.17 mb/d y-o-y.

This performance is due to weaker-than-expected output in 1H21 as a result of stoppages and COVID-19-induced project delays that curtailed 130 tb/d of oil output. It is estimated that liquids output in July grew by 0.09 mb/d m-o-m to reach 3.67 mb/d as unplanned outages eased. According to the production rampups in Búzios and Atapu, higher production of 0.34 mb/d, to an average of 3.9 mb/d, is anticipated in 2H21. Moreover, the start-up of the 0.18 mb/d FPSO Carioca in Sépia field (formerly Northeast Tupi), which is located in the Santos Basin’s pre-salt horizon, is expected in August. For 2022, Brazil’s liquids supply forecast, including biofuels, is set to increase by 0.24 mb/d y-o-y to average 3.99 mb/d. Crude oil production is expected to rise through two new project start-ups: Mero-1 (Guanabara), which was initially planned to start up in 2021; and Peregrino-Phase 2 . The second phase involves the Peregrino south-west area, which is not accessible by the existing A and B platforms. Its development plan involves increasing the number of production wells by the addition of a third fixed platform to the field, Peregrino C, which has already been installed. This will increase the project’s productive life by at least 20 years and will add 250-300 million barrels in recoverable reserves, with the first oil expected in the first half of 2022, according to Equinor. 46 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 World Oil Supply Russia Preliminary data for Russia’s liquids production in Graph 5 28: Russia’s quarterly liquids production July shows an increase of 0.04 mb/d m-o-m to an and forecast average of 10.75 mb/d, higher by 1.1 mb/d y-o-y. mb/d 13 Total condensate and NGLs output from gas 11.88 condensate fields was pegged at 1.21 mb/d in 1H21, 12 up by 0.09 tb/d y-o-y, while crude oil production 11 10.74 declined by 0.5 mb/d in 1H21, y-o-y to average 9.4 mb/d. 10 Annual liquids production in 2021 is forecast to increase by 0.19 mb/d y-o-y to average 10.78 mb/d, 9 revised up by 0.15 mb/d in accordance with the new 8 DoC production adjustments from August 2021 onwards. 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21* 4Q21* 1Q22* 2Q22* 3Q22* 4Q22* For 2022, and given the new production adjustments, Note: * 3Q21-4Q22 = Forecast.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 49 World Oil Supply World oil supply Preliminary data indicates that global liquids production in July increased by 0.97 mb/d to average 95.69 mb/d compared with the previous month. Non-OPEC liquids production (including OPEC Graph 5 31: OPEC crude production and world oil NGLs) increased in July by 0.33 mb/d compared with supply development the previous month to average 69.03 mb/d, higher by mb/d mb/d 2.45 mb/d y-o-y. Preliminary increases in production 32 105 100.3 in July were mainly driven by the OECD, where output 30 100 rose by 0.25 mb/d m-o-m compared with an increase 28 95.7 of only 0.08 mb/d in non-OECD countries, including 26 95 participants in the DoC, as production had already 90 24 been adjusted in July. 85 22 29.3 26.7 The share of OPEC crude oil in total global 20 80 production increased by 0.4 pp to 27.9% in July compared with the previous month.

Source: OPEC. 50 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery margins globally reversed course and moved upwards in July, supported by the seasonal strength of transport fuels, with robust performance registered at the top section of the barrel. In the US, a counterseasonal decline in refinery utilization rates and the subsequent downward pressure on product inventories, as well as strong exports to South America, lifted product markets in the country. Refining margins in Europe benefitted from a reduction in utilization rates within the region in late June, and a tighter key product balance due to limited product arrivals amid sustained road transport fuel consumption linked to an easing of mobility restrictions. In Asia, healthy regional fuel consumption, robust petrochemical feedstock demand and strong conversion margins all led to gains for clean products. Refinery margins USGC refining margins improved, backed by a surge Graph 6 1: Refining margins in product exports to South America, due to massive US$/b refinery outages there. This provided an outlet for 15 product flows from the US, and prevented inventory builds that could have adversely affected refining 10 economics in the country. Moreover, US refinery 5 intakes in July decreased by an estimated 0.2 mb/d, which further helped give way to inventory 0 drawdowns. Furthermore, the summer season support owed to a rise in transport fuel and contributed -5 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 to the positive performance witnessed over the month. In the near term, run rates are expected to trend higher, to allow product stock-up ahead of the WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) hurricane and peak autumn maintenance seasons. Oman (Singapore) US refinery margins for WTI averaged $12.40/b in Sources: Argus and OPEC. July, up by 66<U+023C> m-o-m and by $6.28 y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe strengthened as refinery run rates declined at the end of July, putting refining economics at the start of July on higher ground. These gains were sustained and further extended throughout the month as the relaxation of mobility restrictions in Europe provided significant backing for fuel markets linked to the top section of the barrel. In addition, strong exports – driven by firm fuel requirements from Africa and a tighter product market in the US – further contributed to the upside. However, an estimated rise of 590 tb/d in European refinery intakes, according to preliminary reports, and the subsequent rise in product output, led to stronger product availability, which translated into weakness of products derived from the middle sections of the barrel. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $1.57/b in July, up by 71<U+023C> compared with a month earlier and up by 27¢ y-o-y. In Asia, margins showed the strongest gains relative to the other regions in July, supported by the healthy recovery in India’s fuel sales, which rebounded from the previous month’s declines associated with the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant in the country. At the same time, a shortage in Chinese fuel export quotas, which kept product supplies from China to the rest of Asia very limited, contributed to a tighter product balance in the region. This ultimately supported crack spreads at the top and bottom sections of the barrel. Going forward, the release of the next batch of export quotas to the country’s refiners could boost product outflows from China and therefore weigh on fuel crack spreads in the region. Devastating floods in China and typhoon In-Fa, which made landfall in Zhejiang in late July, affected one of the countries’ largest oil hubs. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia continued to face COVID-19 outbreaks with reinforcement of lockdown measures exerting pressure on local consumption levels, which likely hindered stronger gains in regional refining economics. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia gained 98¢ m-o-m to average $1.97/b in July, which was higher by 72<U+023C> y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates decreased in July to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 91.53%, which corresponds to a throughput % of 16.59 mb/d.

Product markets US market US gasoline crack spreads recovered from the Graph 6 3: US Gulf crack spread vs. WTI previous month’s slump and resumed the upward US$/b trend witnessed from November 2020 to June 2021. 30 Support came from a decline in gasoline output levels 20 in line with reports of lower refinery runs in July. At the same time, strong exports to South America – 10 particularly Brazil due to massive refinery outages – contributed to sharp declines in US gasoline 0 inventories and further supported US gasoline margins. US gasoline prices continued to rise, and -10 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 reached a multi-year record of $99.52/b in July. Ongoing support from strong mobility activity associated with the summer season provided further Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene support.

USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads moved up slightly as the lower jet fuel production rates slowed inventory growth. The recovery in domestic flight activity is set to continue trending upward, although the international travel segment appears to remain under pressure and the situation is exacerbated by the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $7.20/b, up by 12<U+023C> m-o-m, and up by $1.78 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI came under pressure due to weaker fundamentals, although the shift to higher light-end yields by US refiners helped lessen the downside impact in US diesel markets. Over the first three weeks of July, gasoil inventories showed strong weekly builds and settled above the June levels in the last week of the month, which triggered bearish market sentiment. The easing of lockdown restrictions in European markets may attract additional export volumes out of the US and provide support to US gasoil markets in the near term. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $2.60/b, down by 37¢ m-o-m and by 98<U+023C> y-o-y. US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI firmed up, sustained by favourable conversion economics, which encouraged refiners to maximize fuel oil processing rates in secondary units given supportive coker margins. Going forward, the weakness in fuel oil markets could trigger additional fuel oil buying interest as secondary feedstock, given the current strong gasoline pricing signals, as well as the transport fuel optimism linked to the summer season. This should limit the fuel oil downturn in the near term. In July, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $7.02/b, higher m-o-m, but was down by $5.39 y-o-y. 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations European market Gasoline crack spreads rebounded from the Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent previous month’s losses, supported by deep stock US$/b draws in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage 20 hub, which was indicative of a relatively tighter gasoline market in July. Moreover, healthy domestic 10 consumption levels as well as solid exports added to the upside in European gasoline markets. The 0 gasoline crack spread against Brent averaged $16.11/b in July, up by $2.37 m-o-m and by $5.27 y-o-y. -10 Jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 weakened slightly and were affected by a downturn in fundamentals. Rising supplies due to stronger refinery Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene run rates led to a longer balance within the region. Gasoil Fuel oil 1.0% s Although the easing of travel restrictions amid a Sources: Argus and OPEC. strong vaccination rollout in Europe allowed regional flight numbers to almost double in mid-July from their May levels, jet fuel consumption was still overall supressed due to low international and business air travel. Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $4.28/b, down by 59<U+023C> m-o-m but up by $2.62 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads trended downwards as European inland stocks remained high over the month in response to the rise in refinery intakes registered in July. European gasoil prices reached the highest mark since December 2019 and averaged $80.29/b in July, amid strong crude oil prices and rapid COVID-19 vaccine rollouts. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $5.30/b, which was lower by $1.08 m-o-m and also lower by 97<U+023C> y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads reversed trend and showed gains, in line with robust exports to outside the region, despite firm inflows from Russia. The current strength in gasoline cracks has helped conversion margins move higher, which further encourages refiners to convert fuel oil in secondary units. At the same time, expectations of a pick-up in fuel oil exports to fulfil higher power generation requirements going forward, should lead to lower fuel oil availability and should lend support to fuel oil markets in the near term. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $3.88/b in July, having gained 24¢ m-o-m and 30<U+023C> y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92 crack spread rose as India's Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai daily gasoline consumption exceeded pre-pandemic US$/b levels in July in response to relaxed COVID-1915 related lockdowns, according to preliminary reports. 10 Gasoline sales on a daily basis rose to 76,500 tonnes 5 in July, up nearly 3.6% over the same 2019 period and 5.7% over June this year. India's gasoline sales had 0 recovered to pre-pandemic levels in October 2020 -5 before a second deadly wave of infections began -10 hitting the fuel's demand in April. In addition, the Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 shortage in China’s refined oil export quotas has limited Chinese refiners’ exports, which contributed to a tighter regional gasoline balance and supported Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene cracks. The Singapore gasoline crack spread against Gasoil Fuel oil Oman in July averaged $10.25/b, up by $2.94 m-o-m Sources: Argus and OPEC. and by $8.70 y-o-y. Asia naphtha crack spreads reversed course and rose sharply, reflecting the strong positive performance in the gasoline segment amid strong petrochemical feedstock requirements. The end of the steam cracker season led to a sharp reduction in offline cracker capacity within the region and prompted stronger petrochemical feedstock requirements, thus supporting petrochemical margins. In addition, a rise in LPG prices, including those of propane and butadiene as alternative petrochemical feedstock, shifted more buying interest towards naphtha and further contributed to the boost in naphtha markets. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged $2.74/b, having increased by $3.60 m-o-m, and by $2.33 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 53 Product Markets and Refinery Operations In the middle of the barrel, the jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia gained some ground, supported by lower supplies from China, amid firm regional requirements for domestic air travel, mainly in China. The majority of international flights remain suspended due to prolonged border restrictions amid outbreaks of the COVID-19 Delta variant in many parts of Asia, while business travel is still being avoided as much as possible. This likely kept gains in jet/kerosene margins capped. In the near term, the high number of Delta cases in Asia could lead to continued international border restrictions, pointing to downside risks in regional jet fuel crack spreads in the coming month. However, firmer demand from the faster recovering aviation sector in the West could provide some support to the regional jet fuel market, amid expected improvement towards the end of the year as the vaccinated share of the population grows and seasonal heating demand for kerosene picks up. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged minus $4.42/b, marginally up by just 1<U+023C> m-o-m, but up by $3.69 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread moved lower on weaker industrial demand, while the rise in Delta variant infection rates showed a clear negative impact on the fuel’s consumption levels linked to the region’s transportation sector. Over the month of July, Thailand reported a record number of coronavirus cases, while Malaysia reached more than 1 million infections, as the virulent Delta variant turned Southeast Asia into the global epicentre of the virus in July. Meanwhile, China has also reported its highest number of cases since the end of January amid a surge of local infections in the eastern city of Nanjing. Moreover, robust gasoil supplies from India, where the peak monsoon season weighed on domestic consumption, resulted in a rise of gasoil availability for exports. India's western state of Maharashtra in July was hit by the heaviest rain in four decades, with downpours lasting several days and severely affecting hundreds of thousands of people. This weighed heavily on regional gasoil margins. The restrictions on gasoil exports from China due to the shortage in fuel export quotas, if sustained, could provide some support to the market in the near term. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $5.10/b, down by 18<U+023C>/b m-o-m and by $1.53 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spread extended the consecutive y-t-d downward trend deeper into negative territory, affected by strong fuel oil availability in the region. Meanwhile, China’s recent decision to impose consumption taxes on light cycle oil, mixed aromatics and diluted bitumen, as well as a regulatory push from the government to reduce crude import quotas for independent refiners, will likely be supportive of domestic fuel oil markets going forward. In addition, a seasonal uptick in requirements from the power generation sector in the coming months should add to the support in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $9.30/b, down by 42¢ m-o-m and by $4.54 y-o-y.

As soon as positive signs appear on the horizon, offsetting darker clouds seem to emerge as well. Demand for tankers is expected to pick up in 2H21, easing the imbalance versus tonnage availability, further helped by increased scrapping and low new deliveries. However, the rapid spread of the Delta variant has provided some uncertainty to the outlook, potentially pushing off the tanker market recovery into 2022. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in July, falling by 1.7 mb/d, or around 11%, to average 13.8 mb/d. Declines came as Asian and European buying remained muted. Compared to the previous year, spot fixtures were slightly lower, falling by less than 1%. It should be noted that rates began the current low phase already in June 2020, coming down sharply from the exceptionally high levels seen earlier in 2Q21.

OPEC spot fixtures rose m-o-m in July, increasing by 0.5 mb/d, or almost 6%, to average just under 10 mb/d, amid a scheduled easing of production adjustments. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were about 14% higher, rising by just under 1.0 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East averaged 5.9 mb/d in July, representing a gain of 0.5 mb/d, or 6% m-o-m, amid increased flows from the region to the Far East. Y-o-y, the route saw an increase of 0.7 mb/d, or over 14%. Middle East-to-West fixtures declined by almost 19%, or around 0.2 mb/d m-o-m, to average 870 tb/d, amid lower flows to Northwest Europe (NWE) and the Mediterranean. This was around 0.2 mb/d, or almost 32%, higher than in the same month last year. Outside the Middle East fixtures edged up 30 tb/d, or 1% m-o-m, to average 3.2 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were around 6%, or around 0.2 mb/d higher. Sailings and arrivals OPEC sailings continued to rise m-o-m in July, gaining 0.7 mb/d, or over 3%, to average around 22.2 mb/d. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings were 2.1 mb/d, or 11%, higher than the very low levels seen in July 2020. Middle East sailings continued to show m-o-m gains in July, edging up by 0.3 mb/d, or close to 2%, to average 15.6 mb/d. Y-o-y, sailings from the region rose 1.8 mb/d, or 13%, compared with the same month last year. Crude arrivals in July were higher m-o-m on all routes with the exception of Europe. Arrivals in North America averaged 9.0 mb/d, representing a gain of 0.1 mb/d m-o-m, or around 2%, and a 1.2 mb/d, or over 15% increase y-o-y. Arrivals in the Far East averaged 15.0 mb/d in July, an increase of 1.6 mb/d, or 12% m-o-m, and a massive 5.8 mb/d, or over 63%, higher than the same month last year. In West Asia, arrivals more than recovered from the previous month’s losses, rising by 0.8 mb/d, or over 13%, to average 6.9 mb/d. Y-o-y, West Asia arrivals were 2.3 mb/d, or just over 50%, higher. European arrivals were relatively stable in July at 12.8 mb/d, marginally lower than in the previous month and a massive 3.9 mb/d, or 44%, higher than the same period last year.

Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates edged higher m-o-m in July, rising by 4%. However, VLCC rates declined 17% compared with the same month last year when rates were still coming down from very high levels. Rates on the Middle East-to-East route dropped by 3% m-o-m to average WS31 points as flows to Singapore declined. Y-o-y, rates were 21% lower. In contrast, rates on the Middle East-to-West route rose m-o-m by 5% in July to stand at WS22 points as gains in France and Italy offset declines in the Netherlands. However, y-o-y, rates were 12% lower. The West Africa-to-East route also increased by 3% m-o-m in July to average WS34 as insufficient import quotas constricted buying by Chinese independents. However, rates were 21% lower compared with July 2020.

US product imports drifted lower m-o-m, although remaining at a still high 2.6 mb/d. Product exports picked up m-o-m in July, averaging 5.6 mb/d, representing an 8% increase over pre-COVID July 2019 levels. Japan’s crude imports plunged almost 20% m-o-m in June to average 1.9 mb/d, undermined by renewed lockdown measures. Amid lockdown measures and no spectators, the Tokyo Olympics are likely to have a net negative effect on domestic demand, weighing on crude and product imports. China’s crude imports rose m-o-m in June, but remained at lower levels, averaging 9.8 mb/d amid government efforts to rein in teapot refineries and crack down on import quota and tax irregularities. China’s crude imports are expected to be capped close to current levels as refiners continue to destock and amid increased government oversight. Product exports could fall back as domestic demand has been healthy, although the spread of the Delta variant inland adds some overall uncertainty. India’s crude imports continued to fall in June, reaching an eight-month low of 3.9 mb/d, affected by refinery maintenance and the ongoing impact of the Delta variant. In contrast, product imports rebounded by 20% m-o-m to average 1.0 mb/d, led by a strong jump in LPG and naphtha inflows, as the economy restarts. With a sharp drop in new COVID-19 infections, refiners have begun to lift run rates, which could strengthen crude inflows, particularly later this year. OECD Europe crude imports hit a four-month high in April, averaging 7.9 mb/d. More recent data show crude imports have fluctuated, as demand has not picked up as strongly as previously expected. Tanker data show crude exports falling in June, amid seasonal maintenance and reduced flows to China. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports were broadly flat in July, edging down less than 1% to average 6.5 mb/d, near 18-month highs, with higher flows from Libya providing support. Compared with the same month last year, crude imports were 0.6 mb/d, or just over 10%, higher.

After a strong showing in June, US crude exports dropped back to the prior month’s levels, averaging 2.7 mb/d in July, declining by over 0.7 mb/d or 21% m-o-m, due in part to reduced flows to India. Compared with the same month last year, crude exports were around 0.5 mb/d lower, representing a decline of 17%. The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination for May show a decline in flows to key regional transhipment points, such as the Netherlands and Singapore, by 0.2 mb/d and 0.1 mb/d respectively, as well as Canada, which fell by around 80 tb/d. In contrast, flows to China rose by 0.1 mb/d. US net crude imports averaged 3.8 mb/d in July, compared with 3.1 mb/d the month before and 2.6 mb/d in the same month last year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 61 Crude and Refined Products Trade On the product side, preliminary data show US product imports declined m-o-m, falling by almost 7%, or around 186 tb/d. However, the July average was still high at 2.5 mb/d, with lower flows from Russia offset by increased imports from Mexico. Compared with the same month last year, product inflows were close to 0.6 mb/d, or 29%, higher. US product exports picked up m-o-m in July, averaging 5.5 mb/d, representing a m-o-m increase of 0.1 mb/d or around 3%. Y-o-y, product exports were 0.4 mb/d, or 7%, higher. As a result, US net product exports averaged almost 3.0 mb/d in July, compared with 2.7 mb/d the previous month and 3.2 mb/d in July 2020.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Preliminary data indicates that the US remained a net crude and product importer in July, with net inflows of almost 0.8 mb/d. This compares with net imports of 0.4 mb/d the month before and net exports of 0.6 mb/d in July 2020. Looking ahead, the escalating spread of the Delta variant adds uncertainty to crude imports in 3Q21, although recent progress on the $1 trillion infrastructure bill could eventually lead to higher demand for imports. The still narrow Brent/WTI spread is likely to weigh on Asia-bound crude exports in 3Q21, although a recovery in Indian demand is likely to support flows. China China’s crude imports rose m-o-m in June, but remained at lower levels, averaging 9.8 mb/d amid government efforts to rein in teapot refineries and crack down on import quotas and tax irregularities. Preliminary data for July reports the country’s crude imports at 9.75 mb/d. Compared with the same month last year, crude imports in June were a massive 3.2 mb/d, or almost 25%, lower than the all-time record high seen in the same month last year. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia remained in the top position in June, with a share of close to 18%. Russia came in second with almost 17%, followed by Oman and Angola with close to 10% and 9%, respectively.

Looking ahead, China’s crude imports are expected to be capped close to current levels in 3Q21 as refiners continue to destock amid increased government oversight and a policy to somewhat rein in the refining sector. Product exports could fall back as domestic demand has been healthy, although the spread of the Delta variant inland adds some overall uncertainty. India India’s crude imports continued to fall in June, reaching an eight-month low of 3.9 mb/d, affected by the impact of the persisting Delta variant and refinery maintenance. Crude inflows declined by 0.2 mb/d, or almost 5%, compared with the previous month. Y-o-y, crude imports rose by 0.5 mb/d, or more than 16%. In terms of crude imports by source, the latest data for April show Iraq remaining in the top position for the second month in a row, with a share of close to 29%. Saudi Arabia was second with around 15%, followed by Nigeria and the UAE with 10% and 8%, respectively.

In June 2020, net product exports averaged 148 tb/d. With the steady drop in new COVID-19 infections, refiners have begun to lift run rates, which could strengthen crude inflows, particularly later this year. Signs that driving activity is picking up could continue to support product imports and dampen outflows in the coming months. Japan Japan’s crude imports plunged almost 20% m-o-m in June to average 1.9 mb/d, undermined by renewed lockdown measures. Compared with the same month last year, crude imports rose slightly, up by just over 1%. Shares of crude imports by source exhibited some shifts in June; Saudi Arabia held the top spot with a share of almost 37%. The UAE came second, with a share of close to 33%, followed by Qatar and Kuwait, with around 11% each.

Amid lockdown measures and no spectators, the Tokyo Olympics are likely to have a net negative effect on domestic demand, weighing on crude and product imports, before picking up again later in August. OECD Europe The most recent official data show OECD Europe crude imports hit a four-month high in April, averaging 7.9 mb/d. This represents a marginal 1% increase m-o-m. Gains were driven by expectations of a recovery in consumption with the easing of lockdown measures. Y-o-y, crude inflows declined by 0.5 mb/d, or close to 6%. Crude exports continued to contract in April, falling by 0.1 mb/d, or 17% m-o-m, to average 0.5 mb/d on decreased flows from Norway, particularly to China, where crude imports have turned sharply lower in 2Q21. Compared with the same period last year, crude exports were also around 0.1 mb/d, or 16%, lower. 64 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – August 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade As a result, net crude imports averaged 7.4 mb/d in April, up from 7.2 mb/d the month before, but lower than the 7.8 mb/d recorded in the same month of 2020.
