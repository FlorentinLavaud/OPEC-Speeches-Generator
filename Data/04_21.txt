The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) increased $3.51 or 5.7% m-o-m to average $64.56/b, the highest on monthly terms since January 2020. In the first three months of 2021, the ORB was up by $8.82, or 17.2% to average $60.22/b. Crude oil futures prices were higher in March extending previous monthly gains. The ICE Brent front month rose by $3.42 in March, or 5.5%, to average $65.70/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $3.30, or 5.6%, to average $62.36/b. Consequently, the Brent-WTI spread widened to $3.34/b on a monthly average. The backwardation structure of Brent and WTI markets eased over the month, specifically in the front of the forward curve. In contrast, backwardation strengthened for DME Oman and Dubai. Hedge funds and other money managers liquidated part of their bullish positions in the second half of March after market sentiment softened. World Economy The global economic contraction estimate in 2020 is reduced after a better-than-expected actual performance by a number of economies in 2H20. As a result, global economic growth now shows a decline of 3.5% y-o-y in 2020. For 2021, additional US stimulus measures and an accelerating recovery in Asian economies are expected to continue supporting the global economic growth forecast, which is now revised up to 5.4%. However, this forecast remains clouded by uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the speed of the vaccine rollout. In addition, sovereign debt levels in many regions, inflationary pressures, and central bank responses are key factors to monitor. After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, US economic growth in 2021 is now expected to reach 5.7%. The GDP growth forecast for the Euro-zone in 2021 remains at 4.3%, which follows a contraction of 6.8% last year. Japan’s GDP growth forecast remains at 3.1% for 2021, after a contraction of 4.9% in 2020. Following growth of 2.3% in 2020, China’s GDP is forecast to increase by 8.4% in 2021. India’s 2021 GDP growth forecast is revised up to 9.8%, compared to a contraction of 7% in 2020. Brazil’s growth forecast remains unchanged at 3.0%, with government estimates showing Brazil’s economy contracted by 4.1% in 2020. Russia’s growth forecast for 2021 remains at 3%, after contracting by 3.1% in 2020. World Oil Demand The global oil demand contraction in 2020 is revised lower by about 0.1 mb/d compared to last month’s MOMR, now showing a contraction of about 9.5 mb/d y-o-y, with total world oil demand at 90.5 mb/d. In 2021, world oil demand growth is expected to increase by about 6.0 mb/d y-o-y, representing an upward revision of about 0.1 mb/d from last month’s report. Indeed, oil demand in the 2H21 is projected to be positively impacted by a stronger economic rebound than assumed last month, supported by stimulus programmes and a further easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures, amid an acceleration in the vaccination rollout, largely in the OECD region. Nevertheless, oil demand was adjusted lower in 1H21, mainly taking into account the recent developments related to COVID-19 measures in OECD Europe and sluggish 1Q21 oil demand data from the non-OECD region. As a result, global oil demand is expected to average about 96.5 mb/d in 2021. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2020 is estimated to average 62.9 mb/d, showing a contraction of 2.5 mb/d y-o-y, which is an upward revision of 0.04 mb/d m-o-m. The majority of the decline came from Russia and the US. Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2021 is revised down by 0.03 mb/d from last month and is now forecast to grow by 0.9 mb/d to an average of 63.8 mb/d. In the US, higher prices could potentially translate into a higher level of production in 2021, with the drilling and completion trend indicating possible future robust monthly growth. However, the US liquids supply forecast in 2021 is expected to remain unchanged at growth of 0.16 mb/d y-o-y. The other main drivers for supply growth in 2021 are expected to be Canada, Norway and Brazil. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 to average 5.2 mb/d, following an estimated contraction of 0.1 mb/d in 2020. OPEC crude oil production in March increased by 0.20 mb/d, m-o-m, to average 25.04 mb/d, according to secondary sources. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights Product Markets and Refining Operations Refining margins showed diverging trends in March. In the USGC margins jumped, as product markets continued to benefit from the recent rise in unplanned outages, as well as low refinery output levels due to heavy maintenance. This led to a tighter overall product balance and bullish product market sentiment, which helped keep fuel prices sustained. In Europe, refinery margins also rose, but rather moderately. On the other hand, margins in Asia performed negatively as refining economics saw losses as pressure came mainly from the middle of the barrel as the market remained well supplied. Tanker Market Dirty tanker spot freight rates picked up in March, as gains in Suezmax and Aframax outpaced a further slight decline in VLCCs. Increases in the these vessel classes were driven by tighter tanker supply as the blockage of the Suez Canal kept ships waiting on both sides of the waterway amid uncertainties regarding when the disruption would be resolved. After the container ship ‘Ever Given’ was dislodged at the end of the month, rates fell back toward the lower levels seen at the start of the year. The impending emergence of 2Q refinery maintenance in Asia also reduced support by the end of the month. Clean tanker rates in March saw an improved performance East of Suez, while West of Suez routes around the Med eased from the higher levels seen last month. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows that US crude imports were flat in March at around 5.7 mb/d for the fourth month in a row, while US crude exports declined for the third month in a row, averaging 2.7 mb/d, the lowest since July 2019. US product imports surged in March to average 2.5 mb/d, the highest since July 2019, as weather disruptions supported inflows. Japan’s crude imports were broadly stable at the stronger levels seen over the past two months, averaging 2.6 mb/d in February. Product imports were the highest in over three years, averaging 1.3 mb/d in February. China’s crude imports achieved a four-month high in February, averaging 11.8 mb/d, impacted by the Lunar New Year Holidays and stronger buying by independent refiners. Product exports edged up 3% to average 1.5 mb/d, the highest since April 2020, driven by gasoil and jet fuel. India’s crude imports declined sharply in February, averaging just under 4 mb/d, the lowest in four months, as COVID-19 impacts and higher prices weighed on demand. Product imports rebounded in February, to average 1.2 mb/d, the highest in 13 months, driven by LPG inflows, part of a government programme to promote clean cooking. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data shows that total OECD commercial oil stocks fell by 44.9 mb m-o-m in February. At 2,978 mb, inventories were 94.1 mb higher than the same month a year ago, 29 mb above the latest five-year average, and around 57 mb above the 2015-2019 average. Within the components, crude stocks rose by 6.1 mb, m-o-m, while product stocks fell by 51.0 mb. OECD crude stocks were 30.8 mb above the latest five-year average and 42.0 mb above the 2015-2019 average, while product stocks exhibited a deficit of 1.7 mb to the latest five-year average, but were 15.5 mb above the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial inventories declined m-o-m by 1.1 days in February to stand at 68.0 days. This is 6.7 days lower than the year-ago level, 2.6 days above the latest five-year average, and 5.6 days above the 2015–2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2020 is revised up by 0.1 mb/d from the previous month to stand at 22.5 mb/d. This is around 6.8 mb/d lower than in 2019. For 2021, demand for OPEC crude is revised up by 0.2 mb/d from the previous month to stand at 27.4 mb/d. This is 4.9 mb/d higher than in 2020. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Summer oil market outlook Global oil demand in 2021 is forecast to grow by around 6.0 mb/d y-o-y. The year started with new waves of COVID-19 infections, necessitating renewed lockdown measures in many OECD economies. Therefore, the bulk of consumption growth is expected to take place in 2Q21 and 3Q21, with global demand y-o-y growth projected at 12.0 mb/d and 6.5 mb/d, respectively. Gasoline is projected to be the key driver for oil demand recovery beginning with the onset of the summer driving season. Diesel will also provide support, mostly based on economic improvements stemming from the implementation of fiscal stimulus programmes. As the spread and intensity of the COVID-19 Graph 1: Global oil demand for gasoline and diesel pandemic are expected to subside with the ongoing mb/d rollout of vaccination programmes, social distancing 28 27.4 27.4 requirements and travel limitations are likely to be 26.6 26.7 26.3 scaled back, offering increased mobility in various 26 25.6 25.4 parts of the world, especially in OECD regions. In the US, data for 1Q21 showed that total gasoline 24.0 consumption losses are smaller compared to 24 previous months, implying that the impact of COVID-19 on gasoline demand is starting to fade, 22 while data for jet fuel consumption remains far below normal levels. Moreover, the easing of restrictions 20 and increased demand expected in the traditional 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 summer driving season should lift global gasoline Gasoline Diesel requirements even further. Despite projections Source: OPEC. showing a marked improvement in gasoline demand compared to 2020, consumption in the summer months is still not expected to surpass 2019 levels due to COVID-19 related challenges. Global gasoline demand is estimated at 24.0 mb/d in 1Q21, forecast at 25.6 mb/d in 2Q21, 26.7 mb/d in 3Q21 and 25.4 mb/d in 4Q21. On the other hand, diesel consumption is projected to be driven by positive developments supported by sizeable stimulus programmes in many economies, most notably the US. These programmes are expected to encourage growth in industry and infrastructure, particularly in Asian economies, including construction of buildings and roads along with increased demand for agricultural products. The demand for diesel is estimated at 26.3 mb/d in 1Q21 and projected at 26.6 mb/d in 2Q21, 27.4 mb/d in both 3Q21 and 4Q21 (Graph 1). Nonetheless, diesel consumption is also expected to remain below pre-COVID-19 levels for the entire year. On the refining side, the recent crude run cuts due Graph 2: Refining margins to cold weather and maintenance have supported US$/b refining margins, mainly in the US, while remaining 25 more or less sustained in Europe (Graph 2). 20 Following refinery turnarounds scheduled for April, 15 transport fuel demand, particularly gasoline and on10 road diesel, is expected to rise steadily over the 5 summer months, causing refinery intakes to show 0 significant improvement and move closer to pre-5 COVID-19 levels. Nevertheless, refining capacity continues to exceed demand and is expected to Jan 19 Mar 19 May 19 Jul 19 Sep 19 Nov 19 Jan 20 Mar 20 May 20 Jul 20 Sep 20 Nov 20 Jan 21 Mar 21 exert pressure on margins going forward. WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) With regard to global inventory levels, there have Oman (Singapore) been sizeable drawdowns since the middle of 2020 Source: Argus and OPEC. and these are expected to continue in the coming months, mainly due to the successful efforts undertaken by the OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to voluntarily adjust production in response to the unprecedented demand contraction witnessed since 1Q20. These reductions in surplus inventories as well as an expected pick up in product demand will pave the way for a cautious recovery of oil market balance in the summer months, supporting refining margins and throughputs. Nevertheless, the large uncertainty surrounding the fragile recovery from the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 continues to require vigilant monitoring of market developments, despite the wide-ranging stimulus measures and early signs of a return to normalcy as progress continues on vaccination programmes in many major economies. The joint efforts of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the DoC continue to contribute to market stability to ensure efficient, economic and secure supplies of oil to consumers, with a fair return on invested capital.

North Sea Dated firmed to near $66/b in March, its highest monthly average since December 2019. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) value gained $3.51 on average in March, an increase of 5.7% m-o-m, to settle at $64.56/b, its highest level since January 2020. ORB component values rose on higher related crude oil futures and physical benchmarks, although their respective official selling price differentials were little changed for the month, particularly towards Asia, and crude differentials remained weak. Crude oil futures prices were higher on average in March, extending the previous monthly gains after investors in late February and early March turned more optimistic about the global oil demand outlook and were anticipating a rapid tightening of oil market fundamentals amid a restrained global oil supply. Market sentiment strengthened further along with equity markets after the $1.9-trillion US stimulus package was signed into law. The ICE Brent front month rose by $3.42, or 5.5% m-o-m, in March to average $65.70/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $3.30, or 5.6% m-o-m, to average $62.36/b. ICE Brent was $10.50 higher y-t-d, or 20.7%, at $61.32/b, while NYMEX WTI was $12.36 higher, or 27.0%, at $58.14/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in March by $3.34 m-o-m, or 5.5%, to settle at $64.39/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $9.81, or 19.4%, at $60.41/b. Hedge funds and other money managers remained positive on oil price outlooks during the first half of March and kept their combined futures and options net long positions near to the high levels registered in mid-February. In the week to 23 March, however, money managers sharply liquidated their positions and reduced their net long positions by more than 9% to reach their lowest since mid-January this year. The backwardation structure of the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI markets eased over the month, specifically in the front of the forward curve, suggesting that the supply-demand balance outlook is softening. However, the backwardation structure of DME Oman and Dubai strengthened in March on restrained supply of sour crude in the East Suez market. Despite the lower supply of sour crude in March and April, the sweet/sour crude differentials widened again in all main markets in March, particularly in Europe and Asia on better performance of light distillates compared to heavier products, while in the US Gulf Coast (USGC), the spread was little changed. Crude spot prices Spot crude prices increased for the fifth consecutive Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement month in March, on continuing improvement in oil US$/b market fundamentals, with North Sea Dated gaining 80 more than $25/b, or about 64%, since the 60 improvement began in November 2020.

However, the overall physical crude market fundamentals remained weak in March, which was reflected in flattening price forward curves and low crude differentials. Several factors influenced crude differentials. These OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements included high availability of crude volumes for March and April loadings, particularly in the Atlantic Basin; soft crude demand from refiners due to spring refinery maintenance in Asia; the slow recovery of US refinery operations from February outages; and weak demand in Europe partly due to reinstatement of mobility restrictions and local lockdowns. The blockage of the Suez Canal by the large container ship Ever Given disrupted the shipment of crude and oil products for several days, but had limited impact on the physical market as supplies remained plentiful.

The light sweet crude value in the Atlantic Basin fell further due to unfavourable west-to-east arbitrage and lower buying interest from China, as well as rising export volumes in the Mediterranean and the availability of large volumes of unsold cargoes in the West African market that added additional downward pressure on crude differential values. On a monthly average, crude differentials of Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe moved into deeper discount against the Brent benchmark in March, falling on monthly average to discounts of 55¢/b, 33¢/b and 65¢/b, respectively. The CPC Blend crude differential also tumbled in March to a deep discount of $2.42/b on monthly average, and Saharan Blend fell to a discount of 98¢/b during the same period. Despite a lower loading programme from Angola, the crude differential of medium heavy sweet crude Cabinda fell further in March by 49¢ on average to a discount of 13¢/b. In the North Sea, crude differentials also mostly fell last month despite limited supplies of the five North Sea crude oil grades - Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk and Troll - underpinning the North Sea Brent benchmark in April, which will average only about 780,000 b/d, according to Reuters. Forties and Ekofisk crude differentials declined by 19¢ and 4¢, respectively, on a monthly average in March to settle at a premium of 34¢/b and 73¢/b. However, in the USGC, Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars crude differentials were little changed, rising by 2¢ and 1¢ m-o-m, respectively, to a premium of 2.18¢/b and 29¢/b on average in March. In the Middle East, the widening Brent-Dubai front-month exchange of futures for swaps (EFS) limited crude flow from west-to-east and gave additional support to Dubai-related crudes on the spot market. The sour market in East Suez markets also was supported by restrained supplies 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – March 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements from Middle East. The value of the Oman crude differential rose by 45¢ m-o-m in March to a premium of $1.20/b, and the Upper Zakum crude differential rose slightly, by 5¢, to a premium of 2¢/b. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB value gained $3.51 on average in March, an increase of 5.7% m-o-m, to settle at $64.56/b, its highest level since January 2020. ORB component values rose on higher related crude oil futures and physical benchmarks, although there was little monthly change in their respective official selling price differentials, particularly towards Asia, and crude differentials remained weak. The y-t-d ORB was up $8.82, or 17.2% at $60.22/b, compared to the same period in 2020. West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend and Zafiro – rose $3.24, or 5.3% m-o-m on average, in March to $64.30/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy and Kuwait Export – increased by $3.67, or 6.0% m-o-m on average, to settle at $64.88/b. Murban crude rose by $3.34, or 5.5% m-o-m on average, to settle at $64.33/b, while the Merey component rose by $3.60, or 8.4% m-o-m on average, to settle at 46.47/b. The oil futures market After a period of volatility, crude oil futures prices were higher on average in March, extending previous monthly gains after investors in late February and the first half of March turned more optimistic about the global oil demand outlook and were anticipating a rapid tightening of oil market fundamentals amid restrained global oil supplies. Positive market sentiment strengthened further amid signs that oil consumption is recovering in major economies along with improving mobility data in Europe and North America. The oil market was also driven by a firm US equity market after the $1.9-trillion US stimulus bill was signed into law. This is expected to boost the economy and oil demand, as well as benefit global industrial production and trade. A US employment report in February provided further support. Oil prices rose further after an attack on large Saudi Arabia oil facilities at Ras Tanura raised geopolitical risk concerns. Nonetheless, worries eased after oil output appeared to remain uninterrupted. International crude benchmark ICE Brent rose to near $70/b on a daily basis, its highest since May 2019, and US benchmark NYMEX WTI rose above $66/b on a daily basis, its highest since April 2019. In the first half of March, oil prices also were supported by a large decline in US gasoline stocks for two consecutive weeks due to low refinery throughput following the deep freeze and power outages that caused the shutdown of several refineries in the US. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, US gasoline stocks fell by about 25 mb between the weeks to 19 February and 5 March.

It was exacerbated by liquidation of their positions on signs of deteriorating near-term oil demand amid resurgent COVID-19 infections across Europe, India, Latin America and other countries, along with the spread of new variants. Meantime, the global vaccination programmes slowed due to distribution issues and the temporary suspension of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in several European countries over concerns about possible side effects, which weighed on market sentiment and raised the risk to near-term demand outlooks. US crude oil stocks increased for five consecutive weeks, which also weighed on oil prices. According to the EIA weekly data, US crude oil stocks rose by near 41 mb between the weeks ending on 12 February and 19 March. The physical market also showed signs of weakness amid plentiful crude availability and shy demand from refiners. Furthermore, in its monthly report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) signalled that global oil supplies are plentiful, excluding a supercycle in oil or a looming supply crunch, as global oil inventories still look high. Oil price volatility heightened after the Ever Given blocked the Suez Canal for several days, raising worries about potential global supply disruptions of crude and refined products. The ICE Brent front month rose by $3.42, or 5.5%, in March OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements to average $65.70/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $3.30, or 5.6%, to average $62.36/b. ICE Brent was $10.50 higher y-t-d, or 20.7%, at $61.32/b, while NYMEX WTI was $12.36 higher, or 27.0%, at $58.14/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in March by $3.34 m-o-m, or 5.5%, to settle at $64.39/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $9.81, or 19.4%, at $60.41/b. On 12 April, ICE Brent stood at $63.28/b and NYMEX WTI at $59.70/b. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened slightly in March compared to the previous month, as the ICE Brent value rose more than NYMEX WTI. In the first half of March, the ICE Brent value was supported by the excessive optimism about the outlook for global oil demand and tightening oil market fundamentals. But NYMEX WTI prices were weighed down by the relatively rapid return of US oil production, compared to the recovery in US refining operations, after the outages caused by the deep freeze. Sharp US crude oil stock builds and lower US crude oil exports also undermined the price of NYMEX WTI. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened 12¢ on average in March to $3.34/b. The spread between the value of North Sea Dated and WTI Houston widened further in March by 43¢/b on average to $2.06/b, compared to $1.64/b in February. The value of WTI at Houston came under pressure on high crude stock levels in the US PADD3, low US refinery throughput, plentiful supply of similar crude in the Atlantic Basin, and soft demand from Europe and from Asia amid refinery maintenance. US crude oil exports remained low in the second half of February and in March averaging about 2.6 mb/d, compared to about 3.1 mb/d in January, according to EIA weekly data. Hedge funds and other money managers remained optimistic on oil price outlooks during the first half of March and kept their combined futures and options net long positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI near to their high levels registered in mid-February, the highest in a year, with ICE Brent settling at nearly $70/b. However, in the week to 23 March, money managers sharply liquidated their positions by more than 9% to reach its lowest since mid-January, due to deteriorating global oil demand outlooks as well profit-taking after the rapid increase in oil prices earlier in the month. Between the weeks ending on 23 February and 23 March, money managers were net sellers of about 76 mb in both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI. Speculators cut net long positions the most in ICE Brent compared to NYMEX WTI.

Between the weeks ending on 2 March and 30 March, money managers were net sellers of more than 55 mb in ICE Brent, liquidating most of their positions amassed since the beginning of this year. Combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent fell by 55,196 contracts, or 16.0%, to reach 289,779 lots in the week to 30 March, the lowest level since December 2020, according to the ICE Exchange. In the week ending 30 March, gross short positions rose by 20,065 lots, or 31.4%, to 83,976 contracts. Gross long positions fell by 35,131 lots, or 8.6%, to 373,755 contracts during the same period. Hedge funds and other money managers also cut their positions related to NYMEX WTI in March, but at a slower rate compared to ICE Brent. Combined futures and options net long positions in NYMEX WTI decreased by 1,459 contracts, or 0.4%, to stand at 381,604 lots in the week to 30 March. This is due to a decline in short positions by 12,786 lots, or 26.5%, to 35,546 contracts, and long positions fell by 14,245 contracts, or 3.3%, to 417,150 contracts, according to the CFTC. Nonetheless, the long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract fell in March, declining from 6:1 early in the month to 4:1 in the week to 30 March. However, the NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio rose to 12:1 in the week to 30 March, compared to 9:1 in early March. Total futures and options open interest 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – March 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements volumes on the two exchanges fell in March, declining by 4.0%, or 259,892 contracts, to stand at 6.2 million contracts in the week ending 30 March. The futures market structure The backwardation structure of ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI markets eased over the month, specifically in the front of the forward curve, suggesting that the supply-demand balance outlook is softening. Concerns about the recent surge of COVID-19 infections in several countries and reinstatement of lockdowns and mobility restrictions in parts of Europe raised concerns about short-term oil demand recovery, which weighed on nearmonth futures prices. However, the backwardation structure of DME Oman and Dubai strengthened in March on restrained supplies of sour crude in the East Suez market, while an unfavourable west-to-east arbitrage limited crude flows from other regions and supported the prompt prices of domestic crudes. The Brent structure remained in backwardation in March. In the second half of the month, however, the Brent front month came under pressure and the forward curve flattened in the front amid a sharp sell-off as the demand outlook softened. The ICE Brent M1-M3 spread narrowed from a backwardation of more than $1/b in the first half of March, to about 60¢/b backwardation. On a monthly average, the ICE Brent M1-M3 spread narrowed by 14¢, from a backwardation of $1.12/b in March, to a backwardation of 98¢/b. The ICE Brent’s first to sixth month also narrowed by 14¢ to $2.53 backwardation, which makes it economically unfavourable to store crude oil.

In the US, the backwardation structure of NYMEX WTI also eased and the forward curve flattened on the front over the month, while the first-to-second month spread flipped into a shallow contango. First month prices fell more than forward on a sharp sell-off and large US stock builds in March and a slow recovery in US refinery throughputs following the February outages, while US oil production was rising. The NYMEX WTI first-to-thirdmonth spread narrowed to a backwardation of 30¢/b on average in March, compared to a backwardation of 43¢/b one month earlier. However, the backwardation structures of DME Oman steepened last month on prospect of tight sour crude supply in the East Suez market and healthy demand from Asia-Pacific refiners. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 spread widened to a backwardation of $1.18/b in March, from a backwardation of 72¢/b in February, or an increase of 46¢/b. The physical Brent market showed a weaker structure last month, reflecting the slower demand and a wellsupplied crude market. Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread narrowed in March on a monthly average by 34¢ to a backwardation of 54¢/b, compared to 88¢/b in February. In the US, the WTI M1/M3 backwardation also narrowed in March by 8¢ to 27¢/b, compared to a backwardation of 36¢/b in February. However, amid a restrained supply of sour crude supply, the Dubai M1/M3 backwardation strengthened on average in March, widening by 48¢ to a backwardation of $1.17/b. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Crude spreads Despite lower supplies of sour crude in March and April, the sweet/sour crude differentials widened again in all main markets in March, particularly in Europe and Asia, while in the USGC, the spread was little changed. The sweet/sour spread widened on better performance of light distillates compared to heavier products, specifically gasoline, and the increase of the Brent benchmark, a light sweet reference, which was also driven by non-fundamental factors. In Europe, the spread between North Sea Dated and Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC sour crude Urals widened in March by 51¢ to average US$/b at $1.27/b, as the value of Urals dipped on the 40 availability of unsold cargoes for March loadings, and weak demand from European refiners and closed 20 arbitrage to the Asian market as the Brent-Dubai EFS widened, making flow to the east unfavourable. Weak 0 middle distillates and fuel oil margins also put downward pressure on Urals. The Urals crude -20 differential in Northwest Europe fell in March to a discount of $2.45/b on a daily basis against North Sea Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 Dated, its lowest level since April 2020, reflecting a weak sour crude market in Europe. Crude differentials Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals of light sweet grades in the Northwest Europe, LLS-Mars Mediterranean and West African markets also Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. weakened, but at lower pace. In Asia, the previous month’s widening trend of the Tapis/Dubai spread continued in March despite lower supplies of sour crude from the Middle East in March and April. Widening Brent-Dubai EFS made arbitrage of Brent-related light sweet crudes in the Atlantic Basin to Asia difficult, which limited east-to-east flows and consequently supported the value of similar Asian short-haul cargoes of light sweet crudes like Tapis. The BrentDubai front-month exchange of futures for swaps widened further on a monthly average, by 67¢, to $2.57/b in March, compared to $1.90/b in February. Furthermore, soft demand from Asia-Pacific refiners for Middle East sour crude due to maintenance contributed to widening the sweet/sour crude spread. The premium of light sweet crude Tapis against Dubai sour widened in March by 67¢ on a monthly average to stand at $2.76/b. In the USGC, the LLS-Mars spread was little changed in March, widening by only 3¢ m-o-m, to average $1.86/b. Moreover, the crude differentials of both LLS and Mars to WTI light sweet benchmark at Cushing, Oklahoma, were little changed on average m-o-m in March. In the USGC, the value of LLS was supported by firm light distillate margins, specifically gasoline. The Mars sour value also was stable despite weaker middle distillates and fuel oil margin, and expectation of higher sour supplies in April and May after the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced an offer to sell about 10 mb of sour crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – March 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodities were mixed in March. Crude oil prices rose for the fifth consecutive month, while natural gas declined across regions. The drop in natural gas prices was especially strong in the US on the arrival of milder weather, and the rapid recovery of lost production after February’s extreme cold weather. Coal prices rose on concerns about limited Australian exports as a result of flooding. The ascending price trend for base metals extended for the eleventh consecutive month driven by further expansion in global manufacturing, although increases in inventories and the rising US dollar weakened prices towards the end of March Precious metals prices dropped in tandem with the rise in real interest rates in the US. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index advanced m-o-m by 0.9% in March, with increases in crude oil and coal and a drop in natural gas. The average index level was up by 26% in the period January-March 2021 compared with the same three months in 2020. The non-energy index rose by 0.8% m-o-m, with base metals rising by 3.8%, but agriculture commodities retreated by 1.1%. The non-energy index was up by 27% in the January-March period, compared to the same period of 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In March, the Henry Hub natural gas price gave back most gains from the previous month, almost halving m-o-m to $2.6/mmbtu. As mentioned in the previous MOMR, spot prices declined as production quickly returned in early March after the cold snap and warmer than average temperatures followed, resulting in spot prices falling to pre-spike levels. According to IHS Markit estimations, dry gas production during the month was down by around 3% y-o-y. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 14 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 26 March 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 1,764 bcf, around 2.0% below the latest five-year average. At the end of February, stocks were 8.8% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe retreated slightly in March with the average Title Transfer Facility price down by 0.5% m-o-m to 6.1/mmbtu, amid moderate temperatures. In the January-March 2021 period, average prices are twice the level seen in the same period last year. EU Inventories ended March around 30% full versus 36.7% at the end of the previous month, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. This is significantly below the approximate 54% level witnessed at the same time last year. While these inventory levels are likely to be supportive of prices, the small LNG price differential between Europe and Asia favour exports to Europe over Asia, potentially preventing price spikes. Australian thermal coal prices rose m-o-m by 9.4% in March to $94.9/mt, its higher monthly average since February 2019. In the January-March period, prices have been around 31% higher than the same period last year. Prices weakened at the beginning of the month on the news of a slower pace of imports to major consumers China and India, as mentioned in the previous MOMR. However, in the second half of the month, prices rose significantly due to the flooding in the Australian state of New South Wales, which halted exports from the country’s largest coal export port.

While prices have been steadily supported by the expansion in global manufacturing, at the same time, some increases in inventory levels among selected metals and the higher US dollar value limited the upside for prices. Average monthly copper prices rose m-o-m in March by 6.1%. Average prices in the January-March period were 51% higher than in the same period of 2020. Stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) have recovered from very low levels over the last two months, preventing further price upside. In March, inventories at LME-designated warehouses almost doubled from 76,225 tonnes in February to 144,500 in March. According to International Copper Study Group (ICGS) latest estimates, the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in 2020 showed a deficit of 460,000 tonnes. Iron ore prices rose m-o-m in March by 2.7% to a monthly average of $168.2/mt. Average prices in the January-March period were 84% higher compared with the same period last year. World crude steel making activity rose by 4.1% in February 2021 compared to the same month last year, led by a 10.9% y-o-y increase in China, according to World Steel Association. However, there were y-o-y declines in India, the US and Japan. In the group of precious metals, gold retreated by 5.0% m-o-m in March as real interest rates in US dollars increased further. Financial investors significantly reduced their bullish bets in gold during the month. Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ net length increased in crude oil and copper in absolute terms, while it increased in both absolute and as a share of open interest (OI) for natural gas. Net length was reduced in gold, both in absolute and relative terms.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 9 World Economy World Economy The global economic recovery continues, significantly supported by unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus. The recovery is very much leaning towards 2H21. The base assumption of this forecast is that by the beginning of 2H21, COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for emerging and developing economies. In addition, forced private household savings during the lock-downs are forecast to accelerate global economic growth in 2H21 via pent-up demand, especially in the contactintensive sectors. In the meantime, the impact from the pandemic continues, with the EU, Latin America and India seeing rising infections. Growth in 2021 is forecast to be unevenly spread, with the fiscal stimulus in the US and the recovery in China fuelling economic growth in these two economies. In the EU, a reemerging wave of COVID-19 is dragging the recovery in 1H21, while the expectation of good progress in vaccinations in combination with ongoing monetary and fiscal stimulus are forecast to lift growth towards 2H21. At a lower scale, Japan’s economy is forecast to gain pace towards 2H21. While India’s stimulus measures and the expectation of containing the pandemic in 2H21 point at a high growth level as well for the full year, the current dynamic of the pandemic will need close monitoring. Similarly, Brazil and other Latin American economies are facing a new wave of COVID-19 infections which is likely to dampen growth in 1H21. With these counterbalancing forces, the 2021 global economic growth momentum was lifted to 5.4%, with most of the momentum to materialise in 2H21. Moreover, growth in 2020 was revised up to -3.5%, as numerous economies reported higher-than-expected growth rates. Although most of the global recovery is expected to materialise later in the year, there are still some significant uncertainties. First and foremost, the path of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the overarching factor impacting the near-term pace of the recovery, particularly, COVID-19 variants. Moreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates could cause severe fiscal strain. While not imminent, a further rise in inflation, especially in the US and the Euro-zone, may cause some tightening of monetary policies, an area that will need to be watched in the short term. Additionally, traderelated disputes, especially between the US and China, may continue. The OECD growth forecast for 2020 was revised up to -4.8%, after upward adjustments were seen in the UK and some smaller OECD economies. OECD growth in 2021 has been revised up to 4.6% from the previous month’s 4.3%, lifted in particular by improving growth expectations for the OECD Americas. In the emerging economies, India’s growth forecast for 2021 was revised up to 9.8% from 9.0%. India’s 2020 GDP growth was reported at -7.0%. Following growth of 2.3% in 2020, China’s GDP is forecast to increase by 8.4% in 2021, revised up from 8% in the previous report. Brazil’s forecast for 2021 remains at 3.0%, following a contraction of 4.1% in 2020. Russia’s growth forecast for 2021 remains unchanged at 3.0% as well, after contracting by 3.1% in 2020.

Global Update on latest developments With some better than expected GDP growth rates, especially in OECD economies in 2H20, the GDP decline of last year was revised and now stands at -3.5% compared to -3.7% in the previous month’s report. Only two months ago the decline was estimated to stand at -3.9%, and while this is merely backward looking GDP accounting, it also highlights that after the severe impairment of the global economy in 1H20, the quick adaption of the global economy to the new situation in 2H20 led to a better-than-expected performance. The ability of 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Economy the global economy to adjust to adverse situations should not be underestimated, also for the current year. In comparison to the financial crisis in 2008/2009, GDP global growth forecasts for 2010 stood at around 2% in mid-2009 and at around 3% at the beginning of 2010, but 2010 global economic growth was finally reported at 5.1%. Similarly the decline in 2009 was overestimated, but stood then finally at 0.7%. Globally the two economies driving the recovery are the US and China. In the US, the exceptional fiscal stimulus of 1.9 trillion USD in combination with the 900 bn USD package from the turn of the year and the ongoing monetary stimulus should provide the base for an extraordinary recovery in 2021. In China, the successful containment of COVID-19 and the quick domestic recovery should also provide a strong base for recovery that will additionally benefit the global economic rebound. However, the impact from the pandemic will still be felt in 1H21, with the EU, Latin America and India seeing rising infections and consequently social distancing that is harming the economic dynamic of affected countries. Moreover, vaccination programmes continue to be delayed in the Euro-zone. With these most recent development, the contact-intensive services sector has been impaired in particularly 1Q21 and economies with considerable shares in the travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors have been impacted significantly. On a global level, the recovery momentum in the manufacturing sector has been the driving force for recovery. Global trade levels — an important motor for the Graph 3 1: Global trade ongoing recovery — have continued improving, % change y-o-y according to data available up to January.

The base assumption of this forecast is that by the beginning of 2H21 COVID-19 will be largely contained in the sense that the majority of the population in the advanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for emerging and developing economies by that time. In addition forced private household savings during the periods of lock-downs are forecast to accelerate global economic growth in 2H21 via pent-up demand, especially in the contact-intensive sectors. Current pandemic-related challenges, as can be seen in lockdown measures in 1Q21 are considered to be temporary, as the distribution of vaccines is forecast to gain traction and this should lead to a vaccination rate in advanced economies of more than 50% towards the beginning of 2H21. In this base-scenario the two main GDP drivers will be a strong pickup in global consumption and investments. The two major economies that will lead this recovery will be the US and China The recovery will be significantly supported by a rebound in contact-intensive sectors, especially travel and tourism, leisure and hospitality. The summer travel season in the northern hemisphere will add more support. Moreover, it is assumed that inflation will remain at reasonable levels so that central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates unexpectedly. Moreover, new COVID-19 variants and concern that existing vaccines may be less effective against the new mutations are the major risks to the expected recovery.

In a quarterly perspective, the somewhat muted growth momentum in 1Q21, is forecast to gain pace towards the end of 1H21, and to pick up especially in 2H21. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments The US economy has built a sound base for a strong recovery in 2021. With the large fiscal stimulus measures at the turn of the year at a volume of 900 billion USD and the subsequent fiscal stimulus package by the new administration of 1.9 trillion USD, the financial support to the economy is large. The Fed has also continued its strong support, expanding its balance sheet by 326 billion USD in 1Q21. As the vaccination program is making swift progress, with more than one third in the US having been vaccinated and the expectation that in the coming weeks this will move to almost 50%, the base for a swift recovery is likely to gain pace. Some uncertainty remains as to how large the pickup in 1Q21 had been, given the ongoing COVID-19 related challenges and the cold-snap in Texas. It is currently estimated to have stood at 4.3% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR), as estimated by the Secretariat. While some elements in GDP are currently rather volatile and challenging to measure, the 1Q21 estimate by the Atlanta Fed in its GDP projection stands at 6% growth q-o-q SAAR. In the meantime, important lead-indicators are pointing at the continued improvement into 2Q21. Consumer confidence rose strongly to reach 109.7 in March, compared with 90.4 in February and 88.9 in January. One important aspect for future consumption is that the important equity and housing markets continued to perform well, largely supported by monetary stimulus. Housing prices continued to rise in January, growing by 12% y-o-y in January, as reported by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the highest on record. This ties into the most recent discussion of potentially rising inflation and consequently rising interest rates. Most recently, inflation was still muted at 1.7% y-o-y in February. The gauge preferred by the Fed, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, also stood at a relatively modest 1.6% y-o-y in January. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Economy The labour market continued to improve in March, Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market with the unemployment rate falling to 6.0% from % % 6.2% in February.

Near-term expectations The latest fiscal stimulus package leans significantly towards lifting consumption with a $1,400 payment to less affluent US citizens. That accounts to more than $400 billion in the package. Another important lift to consumption should come from an increase of unemployment benefits, accounting to more than $200 billion. Only these two measures are forecast to lift US growth by around 2.5% this year. It depends on the effectiveness of these and also the other measures how much US GDP growth will be lifted, but as it seems further measures could move US GDP growth up to 7% or slightly above in 2021. Moreover, it is assumed that with the strong progress in vaccinations in the US, contact-intensive services sectors are likely to see a strong rebound in 2Q21. Given that the services sector constitutes more than two thirds of the US economy, this is likely to boost consumption going forward. Pent-up demand that is supported by the large fiscal and monetary stimulus is likely to lift the recovery. The fiscal measures and ongoing monetary stimulus are very likely to have already counterbalanced some negative impact of ongoing COVID-19-related challenges in 1Q21. While 1Q21 is forecast to remain impacted by social-distancing measures, holding GDP growth at 4.3% q-o-q SAAR, growth is forecast to accelerate to 7.2% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21 and to around 6% SAAR on a quarterly average in 2H21, led by consumer spending and investment. While concern has come and may continue to come from inflation, price increases seem to be well anchored as especially the labour market does not show signs of overheating, which would lead to significant wage growth and quickly rising underlying inflation. Hence, the main uncertainties in the forecast are either that COVID-19 will not be contained and/or that inflation will rise at such a pace that market rates will carry an unexpected dynamic, impairing the ongoing recovery. However, even with the ongoing low interest rate environment, rising debt levels and associated debt services may cause fiscal constraints going forward. These factors will require close monitoring, but are not expected to pose an imminent challenge. The economy’s recovery is reflected in March’s PMI Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and levels as provided by the Institute for Supply non-manufacturing indices Management (ISM), indicating an ongoing pickup in Index the coming months. The manufacturing PMI rose to 70 64.7 in March, compared with 60.8 in February and 65 64.7 63.7 58.7 in January.

The previous growth estimate for 2020 was confirmed by the US statistical offices at -3.5%. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Eurozone was faced with broad-based lockdown measures in most of its major economies in 1Q21, likely pushing 1Q21 growth back into negative territory. GDP is estimated to have declined by 0.4% q-o-q on a seasonally adjusted based in 1Q21 mainly impacted by significantly slowing domestic consumption and investments – as estimated by the Secretariat Particularly those economies with a large tourism and travel sector have been most strongly affected. This slowing momentum is anticipated to have carried over into 2Q21, as lockdown measures were continued in some countries of the Euro-zone and became even tighter than at the beginning of the year. An important element of the worsening situation of the COVID-19 pandemic was the slow progress the EU vaccination campaign has made in the past weeks. While around a third of the population has received a first vaccination in the US, this number stood at only around 13% or slightly above in the major Euro-zone economies. Positively, the pace of vaccinating is forecast to gain significant pace in the coming weeks, which in combination with the 750 billion euro recovery fund, the NextGenerationEU, are considered to build a strong base for a 2H21 recovery. Ongoing considerable support measures enacted by Euro-zone governments, in combination with fiscal support from the EU and monetary support from the European Central Bank (ECB), have continued counterbalancing the negative effects from the pandemic to the economy. Only in March, the ECB announced that it would like to accelerate the pace of its bond buying programme over the next three months in response to rising borrowing costs and a continued fragile economic recovery. The accommodative ECB monetary policies and the Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales fiscally driven social welfare measures, have % change y-o-y continued supporting the labour market.

Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations While lockdown measures in major Euro-zone economies have been extended into 2Q21, the vaccination program in the Euro-zone has gained pace and is forecast to continue to do so. By the summer, around more than 50% of the population are assumed to have been vaccinated. This in combination with those that unfortunately had already contracted COVID-19 will lead to sufficiently high immunity rates in the population, 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Economy which is likely to facilitate the reduction in lockdown measures over the course of 2Q21. Quarterly growth in 1Q21 will still be relatively low, though it is forecast to gain speed towards mid-year. In addition to the domestic progress, the Euro-zone is forecast to achieve in especially 2H21, the fiscal stimulus in the US will support exports from the Euro-zone to the US and hence will be an important element of the recovery going forward as well. As 1Q21 is forecast to remain affected by lockdowns and other COVID-19-related social-distancing measures, GDP growth is forecast at -1.6% q-o-q SAAR. By 2Q21, growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.2% q-o-q SAAR and to around 10% SAAR on a quarterly average in 2H21. Growth is to be led by consumer spending, investment and a rise in exports. The expected normalisation of social activities will have a consequent positive effect on travel and transportation, leisure and the hospitality sector. Global trade is forecast to recover further. US stimulus will facilitate US-bound exports. The ongoing recovery in Asian economies — especially China, India and Japan — is anticipated to benefit growth in the Euro-zone as well. The March PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed to Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs an ongoing improving situation in the manufacturing Index sector and also the services sector picked up 70 considerably. The manufacturing PMI rose to 62.5 in 60 62.5 March, compared with 57.9 in February and 54.8 in 50 49.6 January. The PMI for services, the largest sector in the Euro-zone, rose to 49.6 in March, after 45.7 in 40 February and 45.4 in January, however, still below the 30 growth-indicating level of 50. 20 10 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit and Haver Analytics.

The GDP growth forecast for 2020 was confirmed at -6.8%. OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Impacted by the strong lockdown-measures during 1Q21, GDP growth is estimated to have declined by 2.5% q-o-q SAAR, as emergency measures for selective areas in Japan, including, importantly, Greater Tokyo, had been extended until 21 March. While the Japanese economy has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic until that date, it started recovering in the past weeks up to mid-April. Mobility increased in the past weeks and this should also be a good base for an improving services sector. However, the situation remains challenging as new virus variants have led large prefectures to re-impose business restrictions, only three weeks after the emergency measures for the Tokyo area have been lifted. Consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved, confirming an improving pace, but the uptick needs to be thoroughly monitored. In the meantime, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) softened its monetary policy stance as it revealed its latest policy review, which implicitly concluded that it may not focus as much anymore on lifting inflation to the 2% target. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 15 World Economy In a move to further mitigate negative implications of the aggressive monetary easing of past years, the central bank launched a scheme to subsidise bank profits to compensate the effects from negative interest rates. Growth in industrial production (IP) remains negative. The IP fell by 2.6% y-o-y in February and by 4.3% y-o-y in January. This was very likely impacted by the lockdown measures at the beginning of the year. In addition, growth in manufacturing orders retracted as well, falling by 0.8% y-o-y in January, which however came after a strong pick-up in December, when orders rose by 18.6% y-o-y.

Near-term expectations The situation remains uncertain in Japan. After COVID-19 emergency measures have been extended to 21 March, the strong enforcement of the rules under the emergency statue have led to an ongoing depressed level of mobility, keeping domestic economic activity at rather low levels. However, the situation has improved. New business restrictions had to be implemented in especially some important prefectures, including Osaka and Tokyo. It remains to be seen, what the mobility trend in the coming weeks will look like. In line with improving mobility, consumer confidence and business sentiment had improved, but the progress will now need to be carefully monitored. It is estimated that 1Q21 GDP declined by 2.5% q-o-q SAAR due to the negative impact from the services sector. As it assumed that the virus will be widely contained in Japan towards the end of 2Q21 a strong rebound is expected by then. Growth in 2Q21 is forecast to rise by 3.2% q-o-q SAAR and by 3.6% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21, before slowing somewhat to reach 3% in 4Q21. March’s PMIs have highlighted the continuation of the Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs two-speed recovery, with the manufacturing sector Index doing relatively much better than the service sector. 60 The manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in March, 52.7 50 compared to 51.4 in February and only 49.8 in 48.3 January, when it even stood below the growth 40 indicating level of 50.

It should be noted, however, that these growth signals compare to the very low base of the first two months of 2020 at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Fixed asset investment and household consumption fell, driven by a short-lived wave of COVID-19 and the resulting caution, and a reduction in travel during the Chinese New Year holiday. Traditionally, economic activity in January and February is influenced by the Lunar New Year public holiday. COVID-19 added a negative layer as officials urged China's population this year to give up their traditional hometown journeys in order to prevent localised resurgences of the virus from spreading nationwide. Consequently, many services that would have benefited - such as travel, tourism and leisure - faced lower growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. Travel and logistics are expected to soften in the near future and some testing and quarantine requirements may remain. Moreover, household consumption is still expected to be a key driver of growth from 2Q21 onwards as consumer confidence and employment conditions improve despite delays in the production and logistics of the vaccination process. National Health Commission officials announced on 31 March that 120 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered in China. The Chinese government set forth a growth target of “above 6%” in 2021. The target is consistent with the shift to lower but high-quality growth during the 14th Five-Year Plan. Household income and business support might be scaled back in an effort to make up for the fiscal losses in 2020. The government could continue its effort to keep macro leverage generally stable and expand credit in line with nominal GDP growth.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 17 World Economy In the meantime, the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI declined marginally to 50.6 in March 2021, from 50.9 in February, as both output and new orders grew at slower rates. In contrast to manufacturing, the services PMI rose to a three-month high of 54.3 in March 2021 from 51.5 in February as domestic demand continued to improve, with new orders expanding the most since December 2020. Overall, according to the IHS Markit survey, business sentiment in last month was among the highest seen over the past seven years. As the first country to go under a lockdown last year and then become the only major economy to achieve positive growth in 2020, China’s economy is expected to post faster pace of growth this year, driven by strong external demand as well as the rebound of local demand. However, as many exports are related to COVID-19, the export boom might gradually dissipate. In addition, prolonged trade disputes with the US also mean that tariffs and technology restrictions could remain in place at least in the short term.

Latin America Brazil Update on latest developments Brazil’s recent macroeconomic indicators suggest that the economy continues to recover, though at a slow pace amid the deterioration in public health conditions due to recent rise of COVID-19 infections. The economy may contract in 1Q21 given tighter mobility restrictions. Retail sales recorded the first contraction in eight months and fell by 0.3% in January 2021, after an upwardly revised 1.3% expansion in December 2020. However, as individual savings rose to 12% of GDP since the beginning of the pandemic, household spending would be key to the short-term economic outlook. Pressures on the labour market continue to ease. The unemployment rate (three-month moving average) declined to 14.2% in three months to January 2021 from 14.3% in the August-October period of 2020. This was, however, the highest jobless rate on a quarterly basis for a quarter up to January. On another positive note, the labour force participation rate rose by 0.7 pp to 56.8%. On the fiscal policy front, the government approved a new round of support known as the “corona voucher”, which should contribute to the economic recovery. 20 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Economy On the monetary policy front, the Central Bank of Graph 3 16: Brazil’s inflation vs. interest rate Brazil (BCB) increased the benchmark interest rate by % change y-o-y % per annum 75 basis points from an all-time low of 2%.

The FNB/BER consumer confidence index (CCI) increased by 3 points to -9 in 1Q21, the same reading as in 1Q20, which implies that the index returned to pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, according to the latest Quarterly Bulletin of the South African Reserve Bank, the current account recorded a rare surplus in 2020 of OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 21 World Economy 2.2% of GDP. This was the first surplus since 2002, driven mainly by the surge in the merchandise trade surplus and a marginal invisible trade deficit decline. In 2020, exports rose by 7% to R1.4 trillion, but in US dollar terms, exports fell by 5.2% y-o-y due to the rand depreciation. Imports slumped in both currencies in 2020, by 12.1% to R1.1 trillion and by 22.2% to $68 billion thanks to cheap oil and weak demand. The trade surplus therefore surged to R285 billion in 2020 from R39.3 billion in 2019. On the policy front, the South African Reserve Bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged at 3.5% at its March 2021 meeting. The central bank raised its 2021 growth forecasts to 3.8% from an earlier 3.6%, but maintained its projections of 2.4% and 2.5% for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, a tax relief plan for consumers and a tax reduction for corporations were announced recently and could lead to increased economic activity in the medium term. Moreover, following the commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for rapid financing, the government’s post pandemic plan would prioritise investment, job creation and power supply. In the labour market, South Africa's unemployment rate rose to 32.5% in 4Q20 from 30.8% in 3Q20, the highest jobless rate since quarterly data became available in 2008 Meantime, the annual inflation rate eased to 2.9% y-o-y in February 2021 from 3.2% y-o-y in January, below the South African Reserve Bank's target range of 3.6% due to the decline in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages. Near-term expectations Following the deep contraction in real GDP in 2020, South Africa’s economy is expected to slowly recover investor confidence and activity across key sectors. Needless to say, the recovery depends very much on COVID-19 vaccinations, which is well behind the government’s target of reaching herd immunity by the end of 2021. For now, South Africa's Absa Manufacturing PMI rose to 57.4 in March of 2021 from 53 in February. Manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace since last October, according to an IHS Markit survey, as all five sub-indexes of the survey improved. In contrast, the RMB/BER business confidence index in South Africa fell to 35 in 1Q21 from 40 in 4Q20 due to weaker-than-expected Black Friday and holiday sales. Additionally, manufacturers were probably less optimistic about business conditions amid concerns over the slow pace of the vaccination rollout.

Russia and Central Asia Russia Update on the latest developments Russia's real GDP contracted by 1.8% y-o-y in 4Q20, following the revised 3.5% y-o-y contraction in 3Q20 and a 7.8% y-o-y slump in 2Q20. The less severe contraction, in comparison to most published forecasts, is attributed to the relatively small share of sectors directly affected by the COVID-19 restrictions, a relatively higher contribution from the public sector and the government’s COVID-19 policy support. The GDP decline was mainly pronounced in the hospitality sector which contracted 20.7% y-o-y. Mining and quarrying shrank 10.4% while utility output fell 3.0% y-o-y. Manufacturing production expanded 2.0%. Considering 2020 as a whole, the economy contracted 3.0% y-o-y compared with 2.0% y-o-y growth in 2019. Following the considerable recovery in consumer spending in January, February’s retail sales dropped by 1.3% y-o-y in February, compared to a 0.1% decline in January. This was the eleventh month of contraction in retail activity amid the pandemic crisis. Labour market pressure eased despite the spike in COVID-19 infections. Russia's unemployment rate dropped to 5.7% in February 2021, down from 5.8% in the previous month. This was the lowest since April 2020 but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. 22 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Economy The inflation rate in Russia surged to 5.8% in March Graph 3 18: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate 2021 from 5.7% in February, and well above the % central bank's 4% target.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 23 World Economy OPEC Member Countries Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s 4Q20 GDP data showed a contraction of 3.8% y-o-y, following a 4.6% fall in 3Q20. This was the sixth straight quarter of contraction in the economy, however the smallest decline in three quarters, due to the easing of lockdown measures. The oil sector contracted by 8.5% y-o-y, amid demand concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-oil sector contracted by 0.8%, with transport, storage and communication recording the biggest drop of 5.8% y-o-y. On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the GDP expanded 2.5%, following upwardly revised 2.0% expansion in 3Q20. For 2020 the economy is estimated to have contracted by 4.1% y-o-y. Looking ahead, the PMI shows steady growth in non-oil private sectors, although falling to 53.3 in March 2021 from 53.9 a month earlier. The reading reflects the impact of the new wave of COVID-19 infections. Real GDP is forecast to grow steadily from 2021 onward, also driven by government efforts to achieve greater economic diversification and increased foreign investment supported by the new draft of corporate law and an increased focus on privatisations. Nigeria Nigeria’s inflation surged to 17.3% in February 2021 from 16.5% in January 2021, the highest reading since February of 2017, as the COVID-19 crisis led to a weaker naira, raising food and transportation costs. Food inflation topped 21.8%, the highest since October of 2005 and transportation surged 14.1%. In response, the government plans to cut import duty on tractors and mass transit vehicles to lower transportation costs and reduce food prices. For the time being, the second wave of COVID-19 infections has been reduced from lateJanuary levels, and optimism has arisen following the arrival of a first batch of vaccines in early March. This has been reflected in the total economy Nigeria Composite PMI, which rose from 51.2 in February 2021 to 52.9 in March 2021. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) COVID-19 infections cases in the UAE have begun to drop, responding to the tighter lockdowns and rapid rollout of vaccines. Overall business sentiment is expected to continue improving, especially in Dubai, driven by the tourism sector, and increased traveller arrivals. According to official reports, the non-oil private sector has seen a stronger-than-anticipated performance in 2020. The postponement of the Expo 2020 ended hopes of a rebound in 2H20, but is expected to contribute to growth in 2H21. The IHS Markit United Arab Emirates PMI recorded its strongest reading since July 2019, surging to 52.6 in March 2021 from 50.6 in February. The recent reading reflects a solid improvement in business conditions, as the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out reportedly boosted economic confidence.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 25 World Oil Demand World Oil Demand The contraction in global oil demand in 2020 is revised lower by about 0.1 mb/d to now show a decline of about 9.5 mb/d. Total global oil demand is now estimated to have averaged 90.5 mb/d. In the OECD, the contraction in demand is revised marginally lower with most of the improvement occurring in the 4Q20. Oil demand is estimated to have declined by 5.6 mb/d in 2020. Lower than expected declines in OECD Americas and Europe, supported by healthier demand from the petrochemical sector were the factors behind the revisions. In the non-OECD, contraction is revised lower by 0.1 mb/d compared with last month, to now show a decline of around 3.9 mb/d in 2020. The latest available data for China indicates better demand than originally estimated. In 2021, oil demand growth is revised higher by 0.1 mb/d compared with the previous month’s estimates. Global demand is now anticipated to increase by about 6.0 mb/d, reaching the level of 96.5 mb/d. The upward revision mainly takes into account a stronger economic rebound than assumed last month, impacting primarily OECD oil demand in the 2H21, supported by stimulus programmes and a further relaxation in COVID-19 measures, amid an accelerated vaccination rollout. Oil demand is adjusted lower in 1H21 mainly to take into account recent developments related to COVID-19 measures in OECD Europe and sluggish 1Q21 oil demand data from the non-OECD region. Gasoline is anticipated to record the highest gains y-o-y, as economic activity recovers globally and unemployment rates improved in the US. Diesel is anticipated to have the second largest growth y-o-y, amid an improved economic outlook for 2021. Furthermore, light distillates will be largely supported by strong petrochemical demand in countries such as China, the US and India. The reduction in international and domestic flight traffic due to uncertainty around COVID-19 pandemic developments will continue to cap jet fuel growth in 2021. In terms of the regions, OECD Americas is anticipated to be the main contributor to oil demand growth as transportation fuel demand recovers. In the non-OECD region, transportation and industrial fuels are anticipated to be the drivers for demand growth, along with petrochemical feedstock, with growth concentrated in China and India. Risks will remain high during 2021, subject to COVID-19 developments, and the pace of reaching herd immunity targets. Developments in labour markets, the structural impact of the pandemic on demand, new energy policies and the effectiveness of the large scale monetary and fiscal stimulus measures are factors that will further impact oil demand in the short term. 26 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Oil Demand World oil demand in 2020 and 2021 Table 4 1: World oil demand in 2020*, mb/d Change 2020/19 2019 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 2020 Growth % World oil demand Americas 25.65 24.35 20.01 22.72 23.15 22.56 -3.09 -12.06 of which US 20.86 19.67 16.38 18.67 19.04 18.44 -2.42 -11.60 Europe 14.25 13.34 11.03 12.85 12.56 12.45 -1.80 -12.64 Asia Pacific 7.79 7.75 6.54 6.69 7.34 7.08 -0.71 -9.11 Total OECD 47.69 45.44 37.58 42.27 43.05 42.09 -5.61 -11.75 China 13.48 11.34 13.25 13.87 14.28 13.19 -0.29 -2.18 India 4.91 4.84 3.58 4.01 5.15 4.40 -0.52 -10.54 Other Asia 9.04 8.30 7.79 8.11 8.33 8.13 -0.91 -10.06 Latin America 6.59 6.11 5.61 6.20 6.12 6.01 -0.58 -8.83 Middle East 8.20 7.88 6.91 7.94 7.65 7.60 -0.60 -7.37 Africa 4.45 4.37 3.77 3.95 4.28 4.09 -0.35 -7.94 Russia 3.61 3.44 3.04 3.20 3.43 3.28 -0.33 -9.20 Other Eurasia 1.24 1.07 0.99 1.01 1.23 1.07 -0.16 -13.04 Other Europe 0.76 0.71 0.55 0.64 0.69 0.65 -0.12 -15.33 Total Non-OECD 52.29 48.05 45.49 48.94 51.16 48.42 -3.87 -7.40 Total World 99.98 93.49 83.07 91.21 94.21 90.51 -9.48 -9.48 Previous Estimate 99.98 93.10 83.07 91.20 94.13 90.39 -9.60 -9.60 Revision 0.00 0.40 0.00 0.00 0.08 0.12 0.12 0.12 Note: * 2020 = Estimate.

The patterns observed in oil demand in recent months continued into the first month of this 6 year. Light distillates and diesel remained in a positive 4 trajectory y-o-y in January, primarily in the US and Canada, while demand for all other products declined, 2 particularly for gasoline and jet/kerosene in line with 0 mobility limitations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. -2 Requirements for both fuels declined by 2.2 mb/d, y-o-y, in January, remaining close to the losses -4 recorded in December.

The industrial production index, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board, posted 107.0 in January, higher than the 104.2 recorded in December and substantially higher during the historical low of 93 index points during 2Q20. In Mexico, oil demand in January was down by more than 0.3 mb/d y-o-y, with gasoline, jet/kerosene and diesel accounting for the bulk of the decline. Canadian oil demand in January shrank by approximately 0.3 mb/d, as a result of bearish gasoline and jet/kerosene requirements. Heating fuels demand was also weak due to warmer weather conditions. Oil demand in the US fell by 1.3 mb/d y-o-y in January, after sharply declining by 1.6 mb/d, y-o-y, in December. Declines were due to large losses in the demand for transportation fuels, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by higher requirements for lighter distillates. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced tourist arrivals by almost 82% y-o-y and miles travelled by more than 9%, according to the National Travel and Tourism Offices and the Federal Highway Administration, respectively. Vehicle sales declined slightly, by just over 1% y-o-y according to Autodata. Lockdowns and restriction measures across the majority of states during January 2021 impacted economic developments, mobility and consequently oil demand.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. Near-term expectations Uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic remains the fundamental underlying factor for the 2021 oil demand outlook in OECD Americas, impacting the general economy and, particularly, the transportation and industrial sectors. Current signals for the short term point at risks skewed to the upside. A comprehensive 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Oil Demand stimulus package in the US is anticipated to provide strong support for oil the demand recovery, primarily in 2H21, while the fast vaccine rollout is already showing significant results in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional support is anticipated from a recovery in vehicle miles travel, in combination with improving unemployment figures and the healthy petrochemical industry. However, oil demand is not projected to reach 2019 levels during the course of the year, as the recovery in jet/kerosene demand depends on increased international travel and the pace of vaccination rollouts in other regions. Consequently, while the transportation sector is foreseen to gain the most over the year, demand will remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments Oil demand in OECD Europe fell strongly by Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y 2.4 mb/d, y-o-y, in January, following a decline of change more than 1.4 mb/d, y-o-y, in December 2020. mb/d Demand for most petroleum product categories 2 posted large y-o-y losses, as a result of renewed restrictions in almost all countries in the region aimed at controlling a further increase in COVID-19 0 infections.

Increases in COVID-19 infection cases, in combination with substantial challenges in vaccine rollouts forced governments to re-introduce strict measures and policies to contain the spread of the virus. Demand in Germany fell the most, dropping by 0.6 mb/d y-o-y, followed by the UK with 0.4 mb/d and Italy and France with 0.2 mb/d each. Substantial oil demand declines were also observed in all other countries of the region, coupled with strong increases in related stringency indexes. Travelling across country borders and within the region became restrictive both on road as well as in the air, sharply reducing leisure activities. Colder weather in large parts of the region prevented even larger oil demand declines. The industrial production index, which excludes construction, fell slightly as compared to the same month in 2020, as reported by Eurostat and Haver Analytics. New passenger car registrations declined by almost 25% y-o-y, while unemployment rates rose.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 29 World Oil Demand Near-term expectations The outlook for the region’s oil demand in 2021 was adjusted lower in 1H21, taking into consideration the latest gloomy COVID-19 related containment efforts in the region. The slow pace of vaccination rollouts and lack of sufficient vaccine counts in several countries inevitably implied the re-introduction of stringent measures in an effort to control increasing cases. These developments and continued increases in infection cases pose a downside risk in the region’s 2021 oil demand outlook. Any short term 2021 oil demand improvements would result from growing economic activity and consequently a successful COVID-19 containment. The current outlook assumes that herd immunity will most likely not be achieved before the 4Q21. In addition, fuel efficiency gains, reduced international travel, teleworking enhancements, and limitations in petroleum product demand will partly remain, capping oil demand going forward. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments OECD Asia Pacific oil demand improved y-o-y Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y although still showed a decline in January, change contracting by 0.4 mb/d, less than the corresponding mb/d decline of 0.9 mb/d recorded in December. Losses 0.8 were largely attributed to less light distillate requirements in South Korea and Japan, mainly due 0.4 to extended naphtha cracker shutdowns. More recent data shows that the recovery may have started in 0.0 February as naphtha crackers returned to normal -0.4 operation, in line with preliminary data.

Following the re-introduction of restrictive measures in Japan, infection cases are on a downward trend. Preliminary data from by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), indicate a y-o-y decline of more than 0.2 mb/d in February 2021.

Sources: JODI, METI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Efficient containment measures in Japan and South Korea seemed to have curbed the further increase in COVID-19 cases. Consequently, transportation fuel demand in 2021 is expected to recover in addition to rising requirements for industrial fuels and petrochemical feedstock. Overall demand in 2021 is projected to rebound strongly in the region, mainly in 2H21, on the back of historically-low consumption in 2020 as well as a recovery in economic activities which would support industrial fuels. Risks are currently seen to be skewed to the upside, as a result of successful measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic on the one hand and the healthy 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Oil Demand economic outlook on the other. Petrochemical feedstock consumption remains one of the main contributors to oil demand growth in 2021 while jet/kerosene demand is projected to continue lagging 2019 levels, as international business and leisure travel is anticipated to remain under pressure. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China oil demand has been recovering since April Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change 2020 posting y-o-y monthly increases ever since. mb/d February demand showed a strong increase of more 2 than 2.5 mb/d y-o-y, after rising by around 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in January.

Source: OPEC. December. Healthy plastic demand as well as new capacity additions are projected to further support demand going forward. Transportation fuel has also increased sharply in February despite some restrictions on travel during the Lunar New Year holidays. Demand for gasoline and jet fuel turned into growth after recording declines in January. February data indicate an increase of around 1.0 mb/d y-o-y from gasoline and jet fuel demand. The substantial decrease in transportation requirements due to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic during February 2020 and the steady increase in mobility supported demand growth. Furthermore, diesel rose solidly by 0.8 mb/d y-o-y in February, after posting growth of around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in January. Gains are in line with expanding manufacturing activity, as reflected in the manufacturing PMI, which registered 50.6 in February and 51.3 in January.

Near-term expectations Risks to China oil demand growth are currently balanced over the short term. Uncertainties around global COVID-19 developments remain high. The economic recovery of international trading partners, particularly the US, as well as that country’s future policy towards China, are providing some downside momentum to the other forecast. On the other hand, as economic momentum continued, supported by healthy exports and China’s strict policies in controlling domestic COVID-19 cases, downside risks were offset. Overall oil demand in China is projected to record solid y-o-y gains in 2021. Solid GDP projections and progressing industrial demand OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 31 World Oil Demand remain the main contributing assumptions to the current year’s forecast. Petrochemical demand is anticipated to drive growth as was the case in the first two months of 2021.Transportation fuels are projected to show respectable gains as well. Jet fuel is estimated to remain impacted by sluggish international air traffic and lag pre-crisis levels, mainly due to a slow recovery in leisure and business travel. India Update on the latest developments Indian oil demand continued to decline in February. Graph 4 5: India’s oil demand, y-o-y change Data showed a drop of more than 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, mb/d similar to the decline recorded in January. Lower 2 demand was seen mainly for diesel, gasoline and jet/kerosene, while light distillates increased y-o-y. 1 Diesel suffered the most, declining by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y on the back of limited demand for on0 road diesel, despite improvements in economic conditions due to an ease in COVID-19 restrictions as the vaccination programme expands. -1 The India’s composite PMI increased to 57.30 points -2 in February compared to 55.80 points in January, while manufacturing PMI dropped marginally from 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* 57.7 in January to 57.5 in February.

Gasoline demand flipped into negative territory for the first time since August on the back of higher retail prices, curbing demand and high base line demand during the same month in 2020. Jet/kerosene consumption has been negatively impact from the reduction in international flights for jet fuel as well as the substitution with LPG for kerosene in residential sector. On the other hand, LPG demand increased y-o-y amid higher demand for cooking fuel, while naphtha demand also inched up in February due to healthy petrochemical margins.

Sources: JODI, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India and OPEC. Near-term expectations Uncertainty remains high mainly due to a renewed COVID-19 wave – which has been increasing in recent days – as well as the pace of the vaccination rollout. Additionally, the high retail prices and the government policy towards excise tax are also additional to the uncertainty factors going forward. Oil demand growth is anticipated to pick up in the coming months supported by a low baseline and an uptick in diesel demand in various sectors such as construction and agriculture. The recovery in transportation fuel demand is projected to be largely dependent on developments in the COVID-19 front as well as from counter measures that the government is expected to put in place. Oil demand is anticipated to gain momentum in light of positive policy measures encouraging private consumption and investment. Supported by the low 2020 baseline decline, oil demand is foreseen to record respectable growth in 2021. Demand for transportation fuels will lead product demand followed by middle distillates, with most of the gains appearing the 2H21. 32 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Oil Demand Latin America Update on the latest developments January’s oil demand in Latin America showed a Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y decrease of around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, similar to the change decline levels witnessed in December 2020.

PMI indices have increased, reflecting improvements in major economic activities. According to IHS Markit and Haver analytics, manufacturing PMI recorded 56.5 in January, following a strong 61.5 reading in December. The latest available monthly oil demand data for Brazil shows a decline of around 0.1 mb/d in February. Most of the decline can be attributed to slower transportation requirements as both gasoline and jet fuel fell y-o-y. Government decision to delay this year's carnival festivities together with COVID-19 containment measures in certain parts of the country have contributed to the decline. Consequently, both fuels dropped by a combined 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in February, following a decline of around 0.05 mb/d, in January.

Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: JODI, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis and OPEC. Near-term expectations Looking ahead, the oil demand forecast for 2Q21 remains dependent on developments in the current wave of COVID-19 infections and its impact on mobility and the overall economic performance. Latin American’s 2021 oil demand estimates remain largely unchanged from last month’s MOMR, with marginal revisions to the 2020 and 2021 oil demand estimations, despite rising COVID-19 infection cases in various countries in the region. Risks appear to be slightly tilted to the downside in light of development on the COVID-19 front and the vaccinations rollout. Positive economic developments supported by fiscal stimulus programs are anticipated to offset most of the negative risks. Transportation fuels are estimated to lead the recovery in 2021 followed by industrial fuel demand, including diesel and fuel oil. Oil demand is projected to record steady growth supported by recovering economic activities and a low base line of consumption last year. As the Brazilian economy continues its recovery trajectory, oil demand in Brazil is projected to lead oil demand growth in the region supported by fiscal stimulus programmes. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 33 World Oil Demand Middle East Update on the latest developments According to complete data for the month of January, Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change oil demand in the Middle East shrunk by around mb/d 0.6 mb/d y-o-y, compared to a drop of around 1.0 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in December.

Source: OPEC. Analytics. In Iraq, January oil demand data also posted a drop of around 0.2 mb/d, after exhibiting a flat performance in December. In February, oil demand fell by 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in Saudi Arabia, and by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in Iraq, indicating a continuation of lower y-o-y oil demand requirements in the whole region. Data from other countries are not yet available. Transportation fuel remains the most affected, as gasoline and jet fuel accounted for most of the declines in Saudi Arabia while lower fuel oil demand accounted for most of the decrease in Iraq. Gasoline and jet fuel shed a combined 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in Saudi Arabia amid reduced mobility compared to previous year levels and limitations in international flights. Looking at industrial fuel demand, the picture remains similar to January with marginal improvements. Diesel and fuel oil showed a combined drop of around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, following a similar decrease in January. Seasonally lower air-conditioning requirements as well as moderate development in construction impacted demand negatively.

Near-term expectations With the lower-than-expected oil demand data for the first two months of the year, the 1Q21 performance is now projected to be lower than initially anticipated, with some possible spill over into the 2Q21. However, further easing of restriction measures are projected to lend support to overall oil demand especially when buoyed by an expected improvement in the overall health of the economy in 2H21. The effective rollout of COVID-19 vaccination programs and a recovery in oil prices are expected to provide an upside potential to oil demand going forward. On the other hand, any additional measures in response to increases in COVID-19 infection cases, together with slower vaccination rates, will provide a downside risk to oil demand in the near term. Transportation fuels are projected to recover as restriction measures ease. In terms of products, middle distillates are projected to return to solid growth during the current year, supported by an uptick in industrial fuel demand. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2020 is revised up by 42 tb/d and estimated to have declined by 2.52 mb/d yo-y to average 62.89 mb/d. US crude and condensate output declined by 0.94 mb/d y-o-y to average 11.3 mb/d, while liquids production dropped by 0.8 mb/d y-o-y to average 17.62 mb/d. Oil supply also declined in Russia by 1.0 mb/d, to average 10.59 mb/d. Moreover, production declined in Canada, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil supply is estimated to have increased in Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana. Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2021 is also revised up by 24 tb/d to average 63.83 mb/d, but in terms of growth, it was revised down by a slight 18 tb/d and is now forecast to grow by 0.93 mb/d y-o-y. The pandemic-driven crash in oil prices in 2020 caused investors to shy away from the shale industry, forcing companies to look at asset sales and mergers for survival. However, while most drillers continue to focus on paying off debt and returning capital to shareholders instead of pursuing growth, higher prices could translate into higher production levels. The drilling and completion trend indicates upcoming robust monthly growth. Active drilling rigs in the US climbed by 13 rigs, reaching 430 rigs for the 17th increase in the past 19 weeks. The US liquids supply growth forecast remained unchanged at 0.16 mb/d, however, tight crude output is forecast to decline y-o-y by 0.1 mb/d, while uncertainties persist. Activity and spending in US oil fields is rising this year as the industry recovers from last year's pandemic-driven price crash, according to energy company executives polled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in a recent survey. Nevertheless, following a drop of $144 billion y-o-y in capital expenditure in oil and gas upstream (E&P) sectors in non-OPEC countries, upstream capital spending in 2021 is expected to remain well below 2019 levels. The main drivers for supply growth for 2021 are expected to be Canada, the US, Norway and Brazil. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2020 is estimated to have declined by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y at 5.13 mb/d. For 2021, OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.21 mb/d. OPEC crude oil production in March was up by 0.20 mb/d m-o-m to average 25.04 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids output in March, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have increased by 0.93 mb/d m-o-m, mainly in the US, due to production recovery after heavy declines in February. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply increased in March by 1.22 mb/d m-o-m to average 93.23 mb/d, down by 7.22 mb/d y-o-y.

OPEC. Source: OPEC. UK oil supply in 2020 is estimated to have declined by 0.07mb/d to average 1.07 mb/d. In 2021, the UK’s oil and gas industry is anticipated to struggle to recover from an investment crunch due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in the longer term, will have to manage a prolonged decline in output. Hence, some projects have reportedly been deferred, such as the Seagull project, which was deferred to late 2022. According to the CEO of Oil & Gas UK (OGUK), “Production may decline further this year and next, following a 5% decrease in 2020, that follows a plunge in development and operations spending in the sector, which slumped 23% year-on-year to 11.6 billion pounds (about $16 billion), the lowest since 2004 in real terms. 2021 is likely to remain highly challenging as companies continue to navigate the operational issues associated with the pandemic along with repairing finances.” Hence, UK oil supply is expected to decline by 0.05 mb/d y-o-y to average 1.02 mb/d. Non-OECD Non-OECD liquids production for 2020 was revised up by 0.02 mb/d and is now estimated to have declined by 1.49 mb/d y-o-y to average 31.66 mb/d. China’s liquids supply is estimated to have grown by 0.07 mb/d y-o-y to average 4.12 mb/d. The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and the consequent lower demand dampened India’s crude oil production in 2020, with output estimated to have contracted by 0.06 mb/d y-o-y to average 0.77 mb/d. Oil production in Other Asia was also revised up by 0.01 mb/d to average 2.51 mb/d and is now estimated to have declined by 0.18 mb/d, y-o-y. Malaysia recorded the deepest yearly decline of 0.07mb/d in the region, followed by Thailand (-0.05 mb/d) and Vietnam (-0.03 mb/d). Meanwhile, Latin America is estimated to have declined by 0.03 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.06 mb/d, with growth in Brazil and Guyana offset by heavy declines in Colombia by 0.11 mb/d, in Ecuador by 0.05 mb/d and in Argentina by 0.04 mb/d, mainly due to the shutting of wells in costly oil fields. Oil production in the Middle East is estimated to have declined by 0.03 mb/d y-o-y to average 3.17 mb/d, while Africa is estimated to have declined by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y to average 1.41 mb/d. Oil production in Russia is estimated to have declined by 1.02 mb/d y-o-y to average 10.59 mb/d, while liquids production in other Eurasia declined by 0.16 mb/d to average 2.91 mb/d.

For 2021, with lower expected spending in the upstream E&P sector and more allocated capex in natural gas production, oil supply growth is forecast to slow to 0.04 mb/d y-o-y to average 4.16 mb/d, revised up by 0.01 mb/d compared to the previous forecast. Latin America Latin America’s total liquids supply in February fell by 0.04 mb/d m-o-m to average 5.94 mb/d, down by 0.36 mb/d y-o-y. Total liquids supply in the region for 2020 is estimated to have declined by 0.03 mb/d to average 6.06 mb/d. This is mainly due to lower-than-expected oil output in all countries of the region following the shut in of wells on the back of COVID-19 and a slowdown in drilling and operations, as well as prolonged maintenance in Brazil. Liquids production in 2020 is estimated to have grown in Brazil by 0.12 mb/d to average 3.68 mb/d and in Guyana by 0.07 mb/d to average 0.07 mb/d. Meanwhile, oil production in other countries in the region has declined. For 2021, oil production is projected to grow by 0.23 mb/d y-o-y to average 6.30 mb/d, revised down by 0.01 mb/d m-o-m. Oil production in Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, Argentina and Peru is forecast to increase, owing to production ramp-ups in fields that started in 2019 and 2020. Production in Ecuador is projected to recover by 0.06 mb/d from outages seen in 2020 to average 0.55 mb/d. Oil production is likely to decline in Colombia by a minor 0.01 mb/d. Brazil Brazil’s crude oil production in February was down by 54 tb/d m-o-m to average 2.82 mb/d due to a decision by Petrobras to temporarily reduce production at the Marlim Sul offshore field due to COVID-19-related safety measures. However, production from late March began to increase, and crude oil output is expected to reach 2.99 mb/d in April, although maintenance is still continuing at the Peregrino field. Production of NGLs increased m-o-m in February by 8 tb/d to average 104 tb/d and is expected to have remained flat in March. According to official data, biofuels production was down by 23 tb/d to average 614 tb/d in January, and preliminary data shows that it remained flat in February and March. In February, Brazil liquids production, including biofuels, fell by 0.04 mb/d, m-o-m, to average 3.54 mb/d.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 49 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Product Markets and Refinery Operations In March, refinery margins showed diverging trends. In the USGC, margins jumped, while in Europe, they rose only moderately as product markets continued to benefit from the recent rise in unplanned outages recorded in the previous month in the US as well as the low refinery output levels due to heavy maintenance. This led to a tighter overall product balance and bullish product market sentiment, which helped keep fuel prices sustained. On the other hand, margins in Asia performed negatively as refining economics showed losses with pressure coming mainly from the mid-section of the barrel as the market there remained well supplied. Refinery margins USGC refining margins exhibited solid gains as Graph 6 1: Refining margins refinery outages caused by extreme winter weather US$/b US$/b witnessed in the previous month contributed to lower 15 15 product supplies.

US refinery margins for WTI WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) averaged $12.68/b in March, up by $1.86/b m-o-m but Oman (Singapore) down by $1.92 y-o-y. Sources: Argus and OPEC. Refinery margins in Europe increased slightly, supported by robust gasoline strength, mainly due to exports, which, in turn, helped boost margins for complex set ups. All other products across the barrel failed to show any upside as the fuel market within the region remained considerably supressed despite slight m-o-m improvements in mobility and fuel consumption levels. However, renewed government restrictions and slow vaccine uptake are set to complicate a speedy recovery in the region and point to further weakness in the coming month. The Suez Canal blockage witnessed during the month affected product markets and triggered bullish sentiment as east/west naphtha, diesel price differentials provided temporary support to crack spreads for the same product in Europe. In addition, the option to take longer routes to bypass the blockage around the Suez Canal represented another supportive factor for fuel oil markets due to higher bunker fuel requirements. However, the quick and successful alleviation of the oil product blockage kept this support limited, which, on a wider spectrum, was of insignificant impact on the monthly figures. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $1.38/b in March, up by 42¢ compared with a month earlier and down by $3.07 y-o-y. Asian product markets, contrary to what was observed in other regions, showed losses as all product cracks, with the exception of gasoline, performed poorly, contributing to margin weakness. Crude processing rates in the region remained relatively constrained, however, ample product availability hindered any upside from the middle and bottom sections of the barrel. Offline refining capacity in the region is expected to rise in April amid peak turnaround season, however, product market performances could face further weakness if the consumption side outlook for the coming month does not become more optimistic. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia lost 73<U+023C> m-o-m to average $1.95/b in March, which was lower by $2.24 y-o-y. 50 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased in March to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 79.38%, which corresponds to a throughput % % of 14.60 mb/d.

Product markets US market US gasoline crack spreads witnessed solid gains as Graph 6 3: US Gulf crack spread vs. WTI gasoline prices continued to climb and reached a US$/b US$/b twelve-month high, the highest level seen since March 2020. This extended improvement was attributed to 20 20 considerable supply disruption within the country, which led to a tighter market and provided a boost in 10 10 prices.

This led to considerable gasoline drawdowns, which provided Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 large support to gasoline crack spreads US gasoline crack spreads gained $7.70 m-o-m to average $23.98 Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene in March, down by $13.13/b y-o-y. Diesel Fuel oil Sources: Argus and OPEC. USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads reversed trends and showed loss as imports for the same product were higher while consumption recovery trends from the pandemic-lows remained slow. Going forward, the start of heavy maintenance works should reinforce supply side support even further, which, combined with projections of rising air travel activities as the weather gets warmer, should sustain the upward trend in US jet/kerosene margins in the near term. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $7.78/b, down by $1.16 m-o-m and down by $1.66 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI lost some ground, pressured by ample product availability evidenced by significant stock builds in US gasoil inventory levels and a significant y-o-y surplus. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $4.54/b, down by $1.17 m-o-m and by $7.06 y-o-y. US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI extended its downward trend in response to stronger crude prices. In addition, the fulfilment of pre-established contract arrivals amid the decline in processing rates resulted in ample fuel oil availability in the country and contributed to the weakness registered over the month. In March, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $4.23/b, moderately up by 2<U+023C> m-o-m but down by $7.71 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations European market Gasoline crack spreads moved up only moderately Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent as strong exports to West Africa served as a muchUS$/b US$/b needed outlet for gasoline volumes and helped boost 20 20 European gasoline margins.

Sources: Argus and OPEC. Naphtha was reported to have priced at a heavy premium relative to jet/kerosene, which, given the current weakness of the latter, could incentivise refiners to shift yields from jet/kerosene to the naphtha pool to achieve more favourable economics. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $3.10/b, down by $1.12 m-o-m and by $5.68 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads moved downwards, pressured by lower gasoil barrel requirements from the US. Moreover, the mobility restriction over Easter holidays within the region weighed further on transport fuel consumption levels and ultimately gasoil crack spreads during the month. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $4.37/b, which was lower by $1.29 m-o-m by $10.28 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads took a downturn and suffered from a rise in prices, as they climbed up for the sixth consecutive month affected by stronger crude prices. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $8.25/b in March, having lost 40<U+023C> m-o-m, but gained $2.34 y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92-crack spreads jumped, extending their upward trend for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by robust gasoline exports to other regions. Gasoline deliveries were reported to have increased sharply in the last week of March backed by higher volume flows to Africa, as well as to Central and South America. In addition, healthy consumption levels from within the region, particularly from India, provided further support to Asian gasoline markets. The Singapore gasoline crack spread against Oman in February averaged $5.53/b, up by $1.37¢ m-o-m but down by $2.84 y-o-y. Singapore light distillate naphtha crack spreads Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai lost ground with the gasoline/naphtha barrel spread, US$/b US$/b moving into double digits.

Gasoil Fuel oil Sources: Argus and OPEC. In the middle of the barrel, jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia reversed trends and moved downwards due to low exports and low regional requirements. The upcoming end of the winter season in Northeast Asia and subsequent decline in kerosene consumption for heating amid moderated air travel activities in the region contributed to the negative performance witnessed over the month. 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $4.32/b, up by $1.06 m-o-m but down by $4.48 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spreads weakened, pressured by limited regional demand as well as lower exports to the West. Travel activities over the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays as well as travel activities in other Asian countries remain lower compared to pre pandemic levels and therefore failed to provide any significant support. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $5.87/b, down by $1.76/b mo-m and by $4.54 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spreads continued to trend downwards, heading deeper into negative territory to reach the lowest level seen since June 2020. The poor performance was attributed to weak domestic consumption levels within the region as well a rise in high sulphur fuel oil prices reflective of stronger feedstock prices registered over the month. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $5.09/b, down by 68¢ m-o-m but up by $4.82 y-o-y.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 55 Tanker Market Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates picked up in March, as gains in Suezmax and Aframax rates outpaced a further slight decline in VLCCs. Increases in the these vessel classes were driven by tighter tanker supply as the blockage of the Suez Canal kept ships waiting on both sides of the waterway amid uncertainties regarding when the disruption would be resolved. After the container ship ‘Ever Given’ was dislodged at the end of the month, rates fell back toward levels seen at the start of the year. The upcoming 2Q seasonal refinery maintenance in Asia also reduced support by the end of the month. Clean tanker rates in March saw an improved performance East of Suez, while West of Suez routes around the Med eased from the higher levels seen last month. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in March, falling around 1.4 mb/d, or more than 8%, to average 14.7 mb/d. Spot fixtures were around 5.2 mb/d, or 26%, lower than the same month last year. Uncertainties about the duration and impact of the Suez Canal shutdown encouraged charterers to delay bookings, amid an environment of ample tonnage availability, certainly once the situation was resolved. An increase in Middle East to East fixtures were more than offset by declines to the West and outside the Middle East.

OPEC spot fixtures fell m-o-m in March, down by 0.2 mb/d, or more than 2%, to average 9.75 mb/d. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were more than 29% lower, down by almost 4.1 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East were the only bright spot, averaging 5.9 mb/d in March, representing an increase of almost 0.6 mb/d, or 10%, m-o-m. Y-o-y, fixtures on the route declined 2.1 mb/d, or almost 26%. In contrast, Middle East-to-West fixtures dropped, declining around 40%, or almost 0.4 mb/d m-o-m, to average around 0.6 mb/d. This was 2.4 mb/d or 81% lower compared with the same month last year. Outside Middle East fixtures fell by almost 0.4 mb/d, or over 11% m-o-m, to average 3.3 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were more than 13% or just under 0.4 mb/d, higher. Sailings and arrivals Sailings improved m-o-m in March, with OPEC sailings averaging 21.3 mb/d. This represented a gain of 1.0 mb/d, or almost 5%, m-o-m. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings fell 2.5 mb/d, or over 10%. Middle East sailings increased 0.5 mb/d, or more than 3% m-o-m, to average 15.9 mb/d. Y-o-y, sailings from the region were down 1.2 mb/d, or 7%, compared with the same month last year. Crude arrivals were higher y-o-y on most routes in March, but experienced mixed movements compared with the previous month. On the positive side, arrivals in Europe increased m-o-m by 0.4 mb/d, or close to 4%, to average 11.4 mb/d, and were similarly 0.4 mb/d, or almost 4%, higher compared with March 2020. Arrivals in West Asia were also higher m-o-m, up 0.3 mb/d, or close to 6%, averaging 5.8 mb/d. Y-o-y, West Asia arrivals were 1.8 mb/d, or 43%, higher. M-o-m declines were seen in the Far East, where arrivals fell 1.8 mb/d or 14% to average 10.7 mb/d, although that was still 1.9 mb/d or 21% higher than the same month last year. North American arrivals also fell, averaging 7.9 mb/d, representing a decline of close to 0.2 mb/d, or more than 2% and a slight gain 0.1 mb/d or over 1% y-o-y. 56 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 Tanker Market Table 7 2: Tanker sailings and arrivals, mb/d Change Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Mar 21/Feb 21 Sailings OPEC 21.21 20.33 21.33 1.00 Middle East 15.86 15.40 15.90 0.50 Arrivals North America 7.91 8.07 7.90 -0.17 Europe 10.78 10.98 11.38 0.40 Far East 11.92 12.48 10.69 -1.79 West Asia 5.32 5.51 5.82 0.31 Sources: Oil Movements and OPEC. Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) After declining the month before, VLCC spot rates slipped in March, down just 1% m-o-m, although were 75% lower compared to the same month last year. Rates were less impacted by uncertainties regarding the closure of the Suez Canal and more by the decline in taker demand with the onset of 2Q seasonal maintenance in Asia. The massive y-o-y decline is due more to the unusual conditions seen last year amid outbreak in the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates on the Middle East-to-East route declined slightly m-o-m, falling 4% to average WS31 points. Y-o-y, rates were 76% lower compared with the same month last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route were broadly flat m-o-m, averaging WS22 points in March. Y-o-y, rates were 76% lower. The West Africa-to-East route experienced a marginal gain of 1% m-o-m to average WS36 points. Rates were 71% lower compared with March 2020.

Suezmax The Suezmax class rose for the fourth month in a row in March to show a gain of 17%. Compared with the same month last year, average Suezmax rates were 45% lower. The further m-o-m gains were triggered by uncertainty caused by the disruption of the Suez Canal. On the morning of 23 March, the 220,000-tonne container ship ‘Ever Given’ ran aground in the canal, blocking all traffic through a waterway that carries about 12% of global trade. By the time the vessel was finally dislodged on 30 March, some 367 ships were awaiting transit through the canal, up from 14 immediately after the ship’s grounding, according to Egypt’s Leth Agencies. These included an estimated 35 crude and 14 product tankers, as well as 16 LNG and 10 LPG carriers. Suexmax tankers are the primary vessels used to carry crude through the canal, averaging around 45 per month. Uncertainty regarding the impact and duration of the disruption temporarily boosted rates for this class and at the same time delayed some cargoes as charterers awaited a clearer picture on how long flows would be disrupted. With the blockage resolved, Suezmax rates fell back from higher levels. While the routes listed in the chart below were not directly impacted by the Suez Canal disruption, they did see some support from an overall tighter market, on the principle that rising tides lift all boats. Suezmax rates OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 57 Tanker Market averaged WS62 points in March on the West Africa-to-US Gulf Coast (USGC) route, representing a 23% gain from the month before. Y-o-y, rates were still 50% lower than in March 2020. Meanwhile, spot freight rates on the USGC-to-Europe route rose 12% m-o-m to average WS60 points but remained 39% lower compared with the same month last year.

Aframax Aframax rates showed the best performance m-o-m in March relative to the larger classes. Gains were seen across all routes, with average rates rising 32% m-o-m. However, rates were still 17% lower compared with the previous year. Support came from the disruption in the Suez Canal, picking up rates from very low levels.

The largest monthly gains were seen in Asia and the Americas. The Indonesia-to-East route rose 39% to average WS90, which was some 26% lower y-o-y. Higher refinery run rates in the region just ahead of the April maintenance season provided some support to rates. The Caribbean-to-US East Coast (USEC) route also enjoyed a 39% m-o-m increase to average WS137. A return from disruptions caused by the closure of US Gulf ports due to freezing weather in February supported the recovery. Y-o-y, rates on the route were still 17% lower. More directly impacted by the situation in the Suez, Med routes experienced increases in March, having been previously supported by weather disruptions in the Turkish straits. The Mediterranean-to-Northwest Europe (NWE) route rose 25% m-o-m to average WS121, which still represented a decline of 13% y-o-y. The CrossMed route rose 27% m-o-m to average WS125, representing a 12% drop y-o-y.

Compared to the same month last year, clean spot freight rates were 21% lower.

East of Suez rates rose by 27% in March but still showed a 15% loss y-o-y. The Middle East-to-East route rose 38% in in March to average WS112. This represented a 26% decline compared with the same month last year. On the Singapore-to-East route, clean freight rates recovered from the previous month’s losses, up 20% m-o-m in March. With an average of WS146, rates were still 5% lower compared with March 2020. West of Suez experienced an 8% decline m-o-m in March and was 24% lower y-o-y. Declines were seen on the Cross-Med and Med-to-NWE routes, which fell 13% each to average WS142 and WS150 points, respectively. In contrast, rates on the NWE-to-USEC route increased 5% m-o-m, to average WS140 points, but remained around 25% lower compared with the same month last year. The monthly gains were driven by increased demand for European product exports to the US East Coast, particularly for gasoline. This has been a longstanding trade pattern for decades and one that that was more accentuated in March due to disruptions from once-in-a-generation freezing temperatures in the US Gulf Coast, home to the country’s refining complex. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 59 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows that US crude imports were broadly flat in March at around 5.7 mb/d for the fourth consecutive month. US crude exports declined for the third month in a row, averaging 2.7 mb/d, the lowest level since July 2019. More recent weekly data shows US crude imports trending higher into April, above 6.0 mb/d while exports have exceeded 3 mb/d for the second week in a row, as the Gulf Coast recovers from February’s freeze. US product imports surged in March to average 2.5 mb/d, the highest since July 2019, as weather disruptions supported inflows. China’s crude imports achieved a four-month high in February, averaging 11.8 mb/d, impacted by the Lunar New Year Holidays and stronger purchasing by independent refiners. Crude inflows are expected to remain at elevated levels in March before falling over the course of 2Q21, as refiners head into the maintenance season. Product exports edged up 3% to average 1.5 mb/d, the highest since April 2020, driven by gasoil and jet fuel. India’s crude imports declined sharply in February, averaging just under 4 mb/d, the lowest in four months, as COVID-19 impacts and higher product prices weighed on demand. Secondary sources point to a pickup in crude imports in March to around 4.2 mb/d. Product imports recovered in February, to average 1.2 mb/d, the highest amount in 13 months, driven by LPG inflows, which are part of a government program to support clean cooking. Japan’s crude imports were broadly stable in February remaining near the improved levels seen in the previous two months, averaging 2.6 mb/d in February, compared to the 2.2 mb/d trough seen in 3Q20. March imports are expected to remain around recent levels. Product imports including LPG were the highest in over three years, averaging 1.3 mb/d in February, as uneven product demand encourages increased imports of specific products. The most recent official data shows OECD Europe crude imports declined m-o-m in December 2020 to average just under 8 mb/d. Crude exports averaged 0.7 mb/d, the highest level in eight months, with increased exports from Norway supported by higher output from the Johan Sverdrup field. Product imports rose to a nine-month high of close to 2.7 mb/d in the last month of the year, driven by outflows of gasoline. US Preliminary data shows that US crude imports were broadly flat in March at 5.7 mb/d, keeping close to that level for the fourth consecutive month. Higher crude inflows to the US East Coast offset recovering flows into the US Gulf Coast, which had been impacted by February’s harsh winter freeze. While less than 1% higher m-o-m, crude imports were almost 10%, or 0.6 mb/d, lower compared to the same month last year when inflows were boosted with the arrival of long-haul tankers carrying crude purchased before the onset of the pandemic. More recent weekly data shows US crude imports trending higher above 6.0 mb/d at the end of March and into April.

Month-on-month, crude outflows were 80 tb/d or 3% lower. More recent weekly data shows US crude exports picking up at the end of March and into April, exceeding 3 mb/d for two weeks in a row. Crude exports were almost 0.9 mb/d lower in March compared with the same month last year when crude exports reached the second-highest on record. The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination shows reduced outflows to the Asian region in January. China’s purchases of US crude averaged 0.4 mb/d in January, compared to 0.7 mb/d the month before. Over the same period, crude exports to India averaged 0.5 mb/d, down from 0.6 mb/d the month before. US net crude imports averaged just under 3.0 mb/d in March, compared to 2.9 mb/d the month before and 2.7 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US product imports jumped in March to average 2.5 mb/d, a gain of 0.5 mb/d m-o-m and the highest since July 2019 when the US Gulf refinery complex was impacted by Hurricane Barry. This represents an increase of 0.5 mb/d over the previous month as well as the same month last year. US product exports improved but remained depressed following the power outage that struck the US Gulf Coast in the previous month. Product exports averaged 4.5 mb/d in March, representing a slight gain of around 2% compared to the previous month, but around 1 mb/d lower than in January 2021 and 1.5 mb/d lower than the same month last year. In fact, product exports remained close to the low seen in May 2020 at onset of the pandemic in the Americas, which disrupted both supply and the export demand side. As a result, US net product exports averaged 2.0 mb/d in March, compared with 2.4 mb/d the month before and 4.0 mb/d in March 2020. Preliminary data indicates that the US was a net crude and product importer in March, with net inflows of almost 1.0 mb/d. This compares with net imports of around 0.5 mb/d the month before and net exports of 1.3 mb/d in March 2020. It was the highest net import level since the hurricane-related disruptions experience in July 2019.

China After taking a short pause in December around a still impressive level of 9.1 mb/d, China’s crude oil imports continued moving higher over the next two months to average 11.8 mb/d in February, the fourth-highest level on record. The increase was driven by a combination of factors, including distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday at the start of the month and increased buying by independent refiners armed with fresh quotas, as well as an overall context of expanding refinery capacity in China. Compared to the previous month, China’s crude inflows in February were up by 1.2 mb/d or almost 12%, while compared to the same month last year, imports were 1.3 mb/d or 12% higher. Crude inflows are expect to remain at elevated levels in March before falling over the course of 2Q21, as refiners head into maintenance. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia remained in the top position in February 2021, with a share of almost 17%. Russia came in second with 16% followed by Iraq and Oman with 13% and 9% respectively.

Product imports reached an eight-month high in February, averaging 1.4 mb/d, up 80 tb/d or 6% over the previous month and around 0.2 mb/d or almost 19% over the same month last year. Gains were driven by industrial fuels, as travel restrictions dampened the usual Lunar New Year holiday exodus, allowing factories to return quickly. China’s product exports edged up over 3% to average almost 1.5 mb/d in February, driven by outflows of gasoil and jet fuel. This was the highest since April 2020, when the refining sector managed to restart after having been disrupted by stringent government lockdown measures following the outbreak of the pandemic. Taken together, China’s net product exports stood near balance in February, at a shallow 38 tb/d. This compares to net exports of 72 mb/d the month before and 0.2 mb/d in the same month last year.

India India’s crude imports continued to decline sharply in February, averaging just under 4 mb/d, the lowest in four months, as renewed COVID-19 impacts and increased prices weighed on demand for crude imports. Crude inflows were down 0.6 mb/d from the previous month and have fallen by a cumulative 0.8 mb/d after marking the second-highest on record in December 2020 at 4.8 mb/d. Compared to the same month last year, crude imports declined 0.7 mb/d. Secondary sources point to a pickup in crude imports in March to around 4.2 mb/d. The latest available data for crude imports by source shows Iraq remained the top crude exporter to India in January with a share of 19%. Saudi Arabia was second with over 16%, followed by the UAE, the United States, and Nigeria, with 13%, 11%, and 7% respectively. Imports from the US were sharply higher at 0.5 mb/d compared to 0.3 mb/d the month before. Product imports rebounded in February, to average 1.2 mb/d, the highest in 13 months, driven by LPG inflows, which served as a source for clean cooking. This represents a 0.2 mb/d, or 25%, increase m-o-m and a 0.1 mb/d, or 12% gain, y-o-y. Product exports edged higher m-o-m, increasing 4% to average just shy of 1.2 mb/d in February. Increases were led by gasoline and jet fuel amid lower domestic demand, partially offset by a decline in fuel oil. 62 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Graph 8 5: India’s imports of crude and products Graph 8 6: India’s exports of products tb/d tb/d tb/d tb/d 1,500 6,000 1,800 1,800 1,200 1,500 1,500 900 4,000 1,200 1,200 600 2,000 900 900 300 600 600 0 Feb 20 0 300 300 0 0 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Apr 20 May 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 LPG Fuel oil Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Gasoil Gasoline Gasoil Gasoline Naphtha Naphtha Kerosene Others Crude (RHS) Jet fuel Fuel oil Others Sources: PPAC and OPEC.

Japan Japan’s crude imports were broadly stable in February at the improved levels seen over the past two months, averaging 2.6 mb/d, compared to the lower 2.2 mb/d trough seen in 3Q20. While unchanged m-o-m, crude inflows were still 10% or 0.3 mb/d lower than the same month last year. Looking ahead, March levels are expected to remain around recent levels, as refiners are content to keep runs low to avoid having to manage high inventory levels of unwanted products. Saudi Arabia remained the top supplier of crude to Japan in February, maintaining that position for the second month in a row with a share of more than 45%. The UAE was second, followed by Kuwait, Qatar and Russia, with shares of 26%, 10% and 9% respectively.

Product imports including LPG were the highest in over three years, averaging 1.3 mb/d in February, as uneven product demand encourages increased imports of needed products, particularly naphtha, LPG and fuel oil. Kerosene imports declined m-o-m but were still at notably high levels for the third month in a row due OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – April 2021 63 Crude and Refined Products Trade to heating demand. Compared to the previous year, product inflows into Japan were almost 0.4 mb/d or 38% higher. Product exports including LPG continued to decline from the relatively high levels seen two months before, slipping 3% to average slightly below 0.4 mb/d in February. This represents a 40% decline from the same month last year. Declines were seen in kerosene due to domestic heating demand and gasoil, while gasoline and fuel oil outflows increased. As a consequence, Japan’s net product imports averaged 0.9 tb/d in February, representing an increase of 0.2 mb/d, or around 24% m-o-m. Net product imports were more than double the levels seen in February 2020.

Compared to the same month last year crude inflows were 1.2 mb/d lower. Crude exports to the OECD averaged 0.7 mb/d, the highest level in eight months, with increased exports from Norway supported by higher output from the Johan Sverdrup field. As a result, net crude imports averaged 7.3 mb/d in December, down from 7.6 mb/d the month before and 8.8 mb/d in the same month of 2019. On the product side, imports increased 0.3 mb/d m-o-m to average 2.7 mb/d, with gains seen across the board, except in fuel oil.
