Major physical crude benchmarks increased about 10% month-on-month (m-o-m) on improving market fundamentals, particularly the prospect of tighter crude supply and the declining trend in global oil stocks. The OPEC Reference Basket gained $5.21, or 10.6%, m-o-m to average $54.38/b. Crude oil futures prices extended gains in January, increasing on both sides of the Atlantic for the third consecutive month, with the ICE Brent front month up $5.10, or 10.2%, in January to average $55.32/b and NYMEX WTI gaining $5.03, or 10.7%, to average $52.10/b. Consequently, the Brent-WTI spread widened slightly by 7¢ but remained at a narrow $3.22/b on average. The futures price structure for the Brent, WTI and Dubai markets was in sustained backwardation last month, evidence that the global oil market is improving, resulting in an accelerating rebalancing process. Hedge funds and other money managers appeared positive about the oil price outlook, raising net long positons by nearly 11% in the four weeks of January. World Economy The contraction in the global economy was revised up for 2020, after a better-than-expected actual performance by key economies in 2H20. As a result, the global economy now shows a decline of 3.9% y-o-y. This compares with the previous month’s forecast of -4.1%. Additional stimulus measures in the US and an accelerating recovery in Asian economies are expected to lift the 2021 forecast to 4.8%, compared to the previous month’s forecast of 4.4%. The US officially reported a contraction of 3.5% for 2020. US economic growth in 2021 is now revised up to 4.2%, from the 3.4% expected in last month’s report. The Euro-zone’s GDP growth forecast for 2020 was also revised up by 0.4 pp to -6.8%, while the 2021 growth forecast was lifted to 4.1% from 3.7%. Japan’s economic forecast remained at -5.2% for 2020 and was lifted by 0.1 pp to 2.9% for 2021. China’s economic growth was officially reported at 2.3% for 2020 and the forecast for 2021 was lifted to 7.4% from 6.9% in 2021. The forecast for India was revised up to -8.2% from -9.0% for 2020 and to 7.5% from 6.8% for 2021. Brazil’s 2020 forecast was revised up to -4.9% from -5.2% and to 2.9% from 2.4% for 2021. Russia’s economic growth forecast in 2020 was officially reported at -3.1%, while the growth forecast for 2021 was improved from 2.9% to 3.0%. World Oil Demand The world oil demand contraction estimate for 2020 was little changed, lower by just 0.03 mb/d compared to the last month’s report. Better-than-expected oil demand data from India in 4Q20 was largely offset by figures showing weaker-than-expected consumption in OECD Americas. Global oil demand is estimated to have declined by 9.7 mb/d in 2020 to average 90.3 mb/d. For 2021, oil demand is now anticipated to increase by 5.8 mb/d, revised down by around 0.1 mb/d from last month’s projection, to average 96.1 mb/d. Revisions are concentrated in the OECD region. Extended lockdowns and the re-introduction of partial lockdowns in a number of countries has resulted in downward revisions to 1H21 projections. At the same time, positive developments on the economic front, supported by massive stimulus programmes, are expected to encourage demand in various sectors in 2H21. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids production in 2020 is estimated to average 62.7 mb/d, representing a contraction of 2.5 mb/d, y-o-y. This is down marginally from the previous report, on the back of several upward and downward revisions in the production of various countries in 4Q20. The contraction in 2020 is driven mainly by Russia, the US, Canada, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Malaysia, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil production increases are expected mainly in Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana. The forecast for non-OPEC supply growth in 2021 has been revised down by about 0.2 mb/d to show an increase of 0.7 mb/d, to average 63.3 mb/d. Supply from the US and Other Asia has been revised lower, whereas supply from Canada has been adjusted higher. US supply is expected to be 0.2 mb/d lower in 2021 from last month’s assessment, to increase by about 0.2 mb/d to average 17.8 mb/d. The key contributors to non-OPEC supply growth in 2021 are expected to be Canada, Brazil, the US, Norway, Ecuador, Qatar and Guyana, while declines are seen coming from Russia, the Sudans, Malaysia and the UK. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by about 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 to average 5.2 mb/d, following an estimated contraction of 0.1 mb/d in 2020. OPEC crude oil production in January increased by 0.18 mb/d m-o-m to average 25.50 mb/d, according to secondary sources. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights Product Markets and Refining Operations Refinery margins improved globally in January, with complex configurations benefitting the most, backed by an improved performance at the top of the barrel. On the US Gulf Coast, the positive impact of holiday season demand sustained transport fuel markets over the month, despite strong refinery runs and rising product inventories. Refining economics witnessed the most limited gains in Europe relative to the other regions due to subdued product drawdowns, seasonal weakness and strict lockdown measures. Meanwhile, in Asia, robust performance at the light end of the barrel filtered through gasoline markets, offsetting the poor performance registered across the middle and bottom sections of the barrel. Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates remained low in January, reportedly below operational costs in some cases, although rates from West Africa picked up. A host of factors have weighed on freight rates, including the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil consumption, reduced supplies on the market, ample onshore inventory and long tonnage lists. The backwardated market structure also provides little incentive to hold inventories in floating storage, even at current low rates. Meanwhile, clean tanker rates improved, supported by activities West of Suez, but are still caught up in general malaise. From the current vantage point, the outlook for freight rates remains lacklustre, certainly in 1H21 but potentially into 2022. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports averaged 5.9 mb/d in January, the highest figure since July 2020, following a sharp increase in inflows from Canada. US crude exports were steady at close to 3.1 mb/d, as renewed outflows to Korea offset lower China-bound volumes. In Japan, crude imports averaged 2.5 mb/d in 2020, the lowest annual average since at least 1980. Japan’s product imports in 2020 averaged 0.9 mb/d, representing a 3% increase y-o-y. Meanwhile, China’s crude imports hit a three-year low in December, averaging 9.1 mb/d. The decline came as independents were largely absent from the market and a backlog of ships waited offshore to be cleared. Early indications expect crude oil imports to rebound in January and February, as independents make use of a fresh round of import quotas. China set a new global record high for crude imports in 2020, averaging 10.9 mb/d, representing a 0.7 mb/d gain y-o-y. India’s crude imports continued to see a healthy m-o-m increase in December, averaging 4.8 mb/d, the first y-o-y gain in eight months and the country’s second-highest on record. In annual terms, India’s crude imports averaged 4.0 mb/d in 2020, a decline of almost 11% y-o-y, representing a four-year low. India’s product imports averaged above 1.0 mb/d for the first time on record, while exports declined for the second year in a row, down 11% y-o-y. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary data for December shows total OECD commercial oil stocks were down by 39.3 mb, m-o-m. At 3,068 mb, inventories are 179 mb higher than year-ago levels and 143 mb above the five-year average (2015-2019). Within components, crude and product stocks declined, m-o-m, by 24.2 mb and 15.1 mb, respectively. At 1,528 mb, OECD crude stocks are 110 mb higher than in December 2019 and 81 mb above the five-year average (2015-2019). Total product inventories stood at 1,540 mb in December, 69 mb above the same month a year ago and 62 mb higher than the five-year average (2015-2019). In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks fell by 1.0 days m-o-m in December to stand at 70.8 days. This is 7.2 days above the December 2019 level and 8.6 days above the five-year average (2015-2019). Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2020 was revised up by 0.3 mb/d from the previous report to stand at 22.5 mb/d, around 7.1 mb/d lower than in 2019. Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 was also revised up by 0.3 mb/d from the previous month to stand at 27.5 mb/d, around 5.0 mb/d higher than in the previous year. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Review of the global oil demand trend The historical drop in global oil demand of 9.7 mb/d y-o-y in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted a shock to the established relationship between oil demand and global economic growth. While demand for all petroleum products declined sharply in 2020, the transportation sector, and aviation in particular, which amounts to around 50% of total oil demand, was disproportionately affected. Within the OECD, all three major regions – Graph 1: Global oil demand growth by region Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific – showed sharp mb/d declines in 2020, although at differing degrees. 15 (Graph 1) In the Americas, oil demand for the 10 OECD 5.8 petrochemical sector partially offset large losses in Non-OECD 5 World gasoline, jet kerosene and diesel, leading to a y-o-y 0 decline of 3.0 mb/d. In Europe, lockdown measures were the most stringent and longest lasting during -5 2Q20 and 4Q20, leading to a decline of 1.9 mb/d, -10 -9.7 y-o-y, for the year. Oil demand in the Asia Pacific was -15 the least affected, declining by only 0.8 mb/d y-o-y. -20 In the non-OECD region, oil demand declines in 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 2020 2021* 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* 2020 were less pronounced. Following a drop in 1H20, China’s oil demand returned to positive growth Note: * 2021 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. in 2H20 – supported by successful containment of the pandemic and a healthy petrochemical sector – to show a y-o-y decline of 0.4 mb/d. In India and Other Asia, oil demand fell on the back of restricted mobility, particularly during 1H20, but improved thereafter, to decline y-o-y by 0.5 mb/d and 0.9 mb/d, respectively, for the whole of 2020. In 2021, global oil demand is forecast to grow by around 5.8 mb/d, recovering some of the losses seen in 2020. At the same time, global GDP growth is projected to rebound based on positive developments, particularly in the US, China and India in 4Q20. With regard to oil demand, the negative impact of the containment measures on transportation fuels is expected to carry over, particularly into 1Q21, with a stronger rebound in oil demand growth, especially for industrial fuels, forecast in 2H21. In the OECD, oil demand is projected to grow by 2.5 mb/d in 2021, led by OECD Americas and driven by a steady partial recovery in the transportation fuels and healthy petrochemical feedstock requirements. Oil demand in OECD Europe is projected to grow by 0.6 mb/d, supported by economic developments. OECD Asia Pacific oil demand is forecast to increase by 0.2 mb/d on improvements in the transportation and petrochemical sectors. In the non-OECD, 2021 oil demand growth is Graph 2: Global GDP and sectorial oil demand forecast at around 3.3 mb/d, led by China. Recovery % change y-o-y is also projected in other regions, particularly Other 15 Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Light and middle distillates will be key to fuelling the growing 5 petrochemical sector and supporting industrial activities, as well as gasoline for transportation. -5 Developments in aviation and general travel will be Transportation sector important parameters for 2021 world oil demand. -15 Industrial sector Indeed, the shock to the traditional relationship GDP between GDP and oil demand that occurred in 2020 -25 further clouds the short-term outlook.

Source: OPEC. large drop in overall world oil demand in 2020, compared to the decline in global economic growth, while the slower recovery in these sectors is expected to have a less positive impact on oil demand growth in 2021 (Graph 2). In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, challenging unemployment levels, trade constraints, the pace of vaccinations as well as the impact of the announced economic stimulus measures into the real economy will continue to cause a large degree of uncertainty. Moreover, the ongoing degree of substitution, phasing out of subsidy programmes, the impact of commissioning, delays, and/or closure of downstream projects, as well as programmes for fuel efficiencies, will all require continued close monitoring during the course of the year. While the global economy is showing signs of a healthy recovery in 2021, oil demand is currently lagging, but is forecast to pick up in the 2H21. With this, a healthy rebound in oil demand, in combination with the vigilant stance and considerable efforts of the countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), are essential to maintaining stability in the oil market.

Major physical crude benchmarks increased about 10% on a monthly average amid continuing improvements in market fundamentals, particularly prospects for tighter crude supply and declining global oil stocks. Spot prices were also supported by the prospect of improving heating oil demand following cold waves in North America, Europe and Asia. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) increased for the third consecutive month in January to its highest value since March 2020, rising along with related crude benchmarks and higher official selling prices, particularly of medium and heavy sour components towards Asia. The ORB value rose $5.21 m-o-m, or 10.6%, to settle at an average of $54.38/b. Crude oil futures prices extended gains in January, increasing for the third consecutive month on tightening outlooks of supply/demand fundamentals and expectations of accelerating oil market rebalancing and global oil destocking. The gains come amid the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and sustained efforts by OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries in the DoC to voluntarily adjust their production. Firm equity markets, a large decline in US crude oil stocks, a weaker US dollar, and cold weather across Asia, Europe, and the US also lent support to oil futures prices. The ICE Brent front month rose by $5.10, or 10.2%, in January to average $55.32/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $5.03, or 10.7%, to average $52.10/b. However, y-t-d, ICE Brent was $8.35 lower, or 13.1%, at $55.32/b, while NYMEX WTI was $5.43 lower, or 9.4%, at $52.10/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in January by $4.82 m-o-m, or 9.6%, to settle at $54.95/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was lower by $9.46, or 14.7%, at $54.95/b. Hedge funds and other money managers were positive about the oil price outlook, raising their net long positions by near 11% in January amid rising crude futures prices and prospects for tightening supply/demand fundamentals, although speculators slowed crude buying in the second part of January as futures prices stalled. Money managers were more positive on the outlook of ICE Brent prices. The futures price structure of all three markets was in sustained backwardation last month, on evidence that the global oil market is improving and the market rebalancing process is accelerating. The historic production adjustments by the DoC participants have largely contributed to this rebalancing process, as has the gradual recovery of global oil demand from last year's lows. The value of light sweet crude strengthened further against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in January in all markets, as light distillate products performed better than heavier. However, the spread remained narrow when compared to levels before the COVID-19 crisis, due to the ongoing tight sour crude market and the prospect of further lower sour crude supply in February and March due to the DoC supply adjustments. Crude spot prices Spot crude prices rose firmly in January along with Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement a rally in futures markets. Major physical crude US$/b benchmarks increased about 10% on a monthly 80 average amid major support from continuing 60 improvements in market fundamentals, particularly 40 prospects for tighter crude supply and declining global oil stocks that prompted refiners to secure their 20 volumes.

OPEC Basket North Sea Dated WTI Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements The oil market was buoyed over January by the decision taken by the DoC early in the month to adjust slightly their supply in February and March, while Saudi Arabia decided to voluntarily adjust its production lower by an additional 1 mb/d in February and March. Spot prices were also supported by the gradual recovery of refinery throughputs in some regions and the prospect of improving heating oil demand following cold waves in North America, Europe and Asia. The three major physical crude benchmarks rose for the third consecutive month to hit their highest monthly average since February 2020. In January, North Sea Dated increased by $4.99, or 10.0%, to average $54.73/b. The WTI and Dubai first month rose respectively by $5.06 and $4.98, or 10.8% and 10.0%, to settle at $52.11/b and $54.76/b.

Nonetheless, crude oil differentials mostly weakened, undermined by softening buying interest from Chinese and European refiners, poor refining margins and weak refinery runs, specifically in Europe, and refiners could lower their runs due to spring maintenances. The rebound in COVID-19 infections and fresh lockdowns and mobility restrictions in many countries and large cities, including in China, the world's largest crude buyer, added to concerns about demand for transportation fuels and weighed on physical prices. Most North Sea crude differentials eased in January on weak refining margins and low demand from European refiners amid reduced levels of refinery utilization rates and runs. Recent lockdowns and mobility restrictions accentuated worries about further deterioration of oil demand in Europe. Furthermore, the ample availability of similar crude quality in the Mediterranean and West African market added downward pressure on crude differentials. However, low February loading programmes of the five crudes underpinning the North Sea Dated benchmark, and the sustained flow of North Sea crude to the east in December and January, provided some support. The value of Forties crude differential was little changed, easing 1¢ on average in January to settle at a premium of 20¢/b against the Brent benchmark, compared to a premium of 21¢/b in December. The value of the Ekofisk crude differential fell by 12¢, to average at a premium of 45¢/b in January. 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements West African and Mediterranean crude differentials also fell in January, and several regional light sweet crudes were trading at discounts to the Brent benchmark amid lower demand from the Asia Pacific and European refiners; recovering supply from Libya; availability of volumes of unsold cargoes for January and February loadings; and subdued refining margins. The strengthening Brent futures structure also put downward pressure on crude differentials. Crude differentials of Saharan Blend and Azeri Light fell by 7¢ and 30¢, respectively, m-o-m, to average at a discount of 30¢/b and a premium of 82¢/b. Crude differentials of Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe also fell on a monthly average in January by 36¢, 28¢ and 53¢, respectively, to stand at discounts of 30¢/b, 22¢/b, and 48¢/b. In the Middle East, the value of Dubai-related crudes for February loading strengthened on the spot market in the first part of January with Murban traded at a premium to its OSP, though differentials weakened in the rest of the month on softening demand from Asian refiners. The value of Oman crude differentials fell by 24¢ m-o-m, to a premium of 51¢/b, and Upper Zakum crude differentials fell by 12¢ to a discount of 4¢/b. However, in the US Gulf Coast (USGC), crude differentials mostly strengthened on a monthly average in January supported by restrained US crude supply, healthy demand from regional refiners, declining crude oil stocks in PADD3, and sustained US exports from the USGC. The WTI Houston crude differential against NYMEX WTI rose 6¢ in January on average to a premium of $1.59/b, and LLS and Mars crude differentials also rose. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB increased for the third consecutive month in January to its highest since March 2020, rising along with higher related crude benchmarks and official selling prices, particularly of medium and heavy sour components for Asia. The ORB value rose $5.21 m-o-m, or 10.6%, to settle at an average of $54.38/b. All ORB component values rose in January, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend and Zafiro – rising $4.92, or 10.1% m-o-m on average, to $53.66/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy and Kuwait Export – increased by $5.24, or 10.6% m-o-m on average, to settle at $54.68/b. Murban crude rose by $5.45, or 11.0% m-o-m on average, to settle at $54.93/b. The Merey component also rose by $4.70, or 14.4% m-o-m on average, to settle at $37.40/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices extended gains in January, rising for the third consecutive month on tightening outlooks of supply/demand fundamentals and expectations for accelerating oil market rebalancing and global oil destocking. The gains were further bolstered by firm equity markets, which were underpinned by expectations that fresh economic stimulus measures under the new US administration would boost the economy and oil demand. Crude futures rose to their highest levels in 11 months with ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI climbing 9.2% and 9.7% respectively on a monthly average. Oil prices rallied in the first half of January and gained about $5, buoyed by prospects of tighter global crude supply accelerating the global oil stock draws, and optimism about oil demand recovery as more countries approve COVID-19 vaccines and begin vaccination campaigns. Market confidence strengthened further after data showed a strong conformity level of December 2020 production adjustments under the DoC, in addition Saudi Arabia has unilaterally decided to voluntary adjust its production lower by a further 1 mb/d in February and March. A weaker US dollar and cold snaps across North America, Europe and Asia that could raise heating oil demand also lent support to crude oil prices. Futures prices were supported by a large draw in US crude oil stocks. Stock levels declined by near 27 mb between early December and the week of 22 January, to hit their lowest since March 2020, amid recovering in US crude refinery crude runs, particularly in the US PADD2 and PADD3. US refinery utilization was at about 82% of operable capacity during the first three weeks of January, or about 14.7 mb/d, compared to 79% in December, or about 14.2 mb/d. In the second part of January, however, oil prices steadied and remained trading in a narrow range as investors eyed the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in many countries, including in Europe and in China, while governments re-imposed strict lockdowns, amid the spreading of new mutations of the virus, which could slow anticipated oil demand recovery. Several European countries and Chinese provinces reinstated further tight lockdown measures and mobility restrictions. Meanwhile, logistical and availability issues delayed deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines in Europe. Positive market sentiment also cooled after Chinses official data showed a decline in the country’s crude imports in December, and signs of easing crude buying interest in the physical market. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements Table 1 2: Crude oil futures, US$/b Change Year-to-date Dec 20 Jan 21 Jan/Dec % 2020 2021 Future crude NYMEX WTI 47.07 52.10 5.03 10.7 57.53 52.10 ICE Brent 50.22 55.32 5.10 10.2 63.67 55.32 DME Oman 50.13 54.95 4.82 9.6 64.41 54.95 Spread ICE Brent-NYMEX WTI 3.15 3.22 0.07 2.2 6.14 3.22 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: CME, DME, ICE and OPEC. The ICE Brent front month rose by $5.10, or 10.2%, in January to average $55.32/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $5.03, or 10.7%, to average $52.10/b. ICE Brent was $8.35 lower y-t-d, or 13.1%, at $55.32/b, while NYMEX WTI was $5.43 lower, or 9.4%, at $52.10/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices rose in January by $4.82 m-o-m, or 9.6%, to settle at $54.95/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was lower by $9.46, or 14.7%, at $54.95/b. On 10 February, ICE Brent stood at $61.47/b and NYMEX WTI at $58.68/b. The ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI spread widened by a slight 7¢ in January to remain narrow at $3.22/b on average. The NYMEX WTI price was supported by the gradual recovery of domestic demand, limited US supply growth, and declining US crude oil stocks, including a large decline at Cushing, Oklahoma. Nonetheless, the spread between the value of North Sea Dated and WTI Houston's first month narrowed in January by 11¢/b on a monthly average to stand at $1.04/b, compared to $1.15/b in December. This is due to easing buying interest for Brent-related grades from Chinese buyers and adequate supply of light sweet crude in the Atlantic Basin, while in the USGC, WTI was buoyed by healthy crude demand and declining stocks in the US PADD3 and sustained demand for exports. Hedge funds and other money managers were positive about the oil price outlook and raised their net long positions by nearly 11% in January amid rising futures crude prices, prospects for tightening supply/demand fundamentals, and accelerating easing of the global oil stock overhang, although speculators slowed crude buying in the second part of January as futures prices stalled. Money managers diverged on their perception of the price outlook for ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI. While they accelerated purchases and raised their net long positions in ICE Brent, they decelerated buying in NYMEX WTI. By the end of the week of 26 January, money managers were net buyers of about 67 mb in the two main crude oil futures and options contracts and held an equivalent of about 681 mb, the highest level since early January 2020.

Combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent increased by 57,855 contracts, or 20.6%, to reach 338,153 lots in the week of 26 January, according to the ICE Exchange. In the week ending 26 January, gross short positions rose by 7,313 lots, or 15.8%, to 53,503 contracts, while gross long positions rose by 65,168 lots, or 20.0%, to 391,656 contracts during the same period. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements However, hedge funds and other money managers raised slightly their bullish positions related to NYMEX WTI in January. Compared to late December, speculators increased their related NYMEX WTI net long positions by 8,917 contracts, or 2.7%, to stand at 342,701 lots in the week of 26 January. This is due to a rise in short positions by 19,037 lots, or 36.5%, to 71,264 contracts, and an increase of 27,954 contracts, or 7.2%, in long positions to 413,965 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract were at about 7:1 in January, almost unchanged compared at 7:1 in late December. However, the NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio fell slightly to 6:1 in the week to 26 January, compared to 7:1 in late December. Total futures and options open interest volumes on the two exchanges rose over January, increasing by 7.7%, or 421,986 contracts, to stand at 5.9 million contracts in the week ending 26 January. The futures market structure Since last month, the futures price structure of all three markets was in sustained backwardation, evidence that the global oil market is tightening and the market rebalancing process is accelerating and reflecting the decline in global crude oil inventory levels. The historic production adjustments by OPEC and participating non-OPEC producers in the DoC have contributed to this process, as has the gradual recovery of global oil demand from last year's lows. The forward curve of Brent futures steepened in January on the prospect of tightening global crude supplies, declining global oil inventories and expectations of gradual oil demand recovery as COVID-19 immunizations continue. The ICE Brent M1-M3 spread slipped into a backwardation of 30¢ on average in January, compared to a shallow contango of 1¢/b in December. The lower Urals loading programme in February and easing supply overhang in the Atlantic Basin also contributed to firming Brent market structure. The ICE Brent’s first to sixthmonth moved into deeper backwardation last month to settle at $1.09 on average compared to a backwardation of 18¢/b one month earlier, contributing is reducing floating storage in the Atlantic Basin.

DME Oman and Dubai’s price structures remained in firm backwardation last month, amid the prospect of further tightening of the sour crude market as DoC countries decided to adjust only slightly higher their production and Saudi Arabia pledged to adjust lower its production by a further 1 mb/d in March and April. Furthermore, sustained crude buying of Mideast crude from Asia-Pacific refiners, including China, India and Japan, bolstered prompt month prices. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 backwardation was little changed again m-o-m in January, narrowing only 2¢ to 54¢/b on average, from a backwardation of 56¢/b in December. In the US, the NYMEX WTI forward curve flipped to backwardation in January and steepened over the month on a significant decline of crude oil stocks in the US and particularly at Cushing, Oklahoma, amid limited US oil supply growth, a gradual recovery in refinery runs and sustained US crude exports. The Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub observed a decline of 10.5 mb, or 15.2%, in January, according to EIA weekly data, amid increasing refinery intakes, specifically in PADD2 and PADD3, and sustained US crude oil exports that stand at about 3.0 mb/d on average during the same period. The NYMEX WTI M1-M3 spread slipped to a backwardation of 10¢/b on average in January, compared to a contango of 27¢/b in December. The M1-M3 spread rose late in the month to its highest in about a year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Regarding the M1/M3 structure, the North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread widened to a backwardation of 13¢/b in January on a monthly average, compared to a backwardation of 9¢/b in December. In the US, the WTI M1/M3 spread flipped to a backwardation of 6¢/b on monthly average in January, from a contango of 28¢/b in December. However, the Dubai M1/M3 monthly average spread narrowed slightly to a backwardation of 47¢/b on average in January, from a backwardation of 52¢/b in December. Crude spreads Despite the ongoing tight sour crude market and the prospect of further supply tightening in February and March due to the DoC adjustments, the value of light sweet crude strengthened further against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in January in all markets, as light distillate products performed better than heavier. However, the spread remained narrow when compared to levels before the COVID-19 crisis. In Europe, the value of the Urals sour grade settled at Graph 1 7: Differential in Europe, Asia and USGC a premium level in January against the light sweet US$/b benchmark North Sea Dated, although this premium 40 narrowed by 17¢ to 16¢/b on average in January. The Urals crude value came under pressure on weaker 20 European demand for the grade and weak fuel oil margins in almost all markets, while the value of light 0 sweet crude was also supported by improving naphtha and gasoline margins. Easing floating storage of light -20 crude in the Atlantic Basin also added support. Nonetheless, the Urals crude value remained Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 supported by tight sour market and expectations of Tapis-Dubai sharply lower availability of Urals crude for February North Sea Dated-Urals loading, probably due to higher demand from Russian LLS-Mars refineries to meet domestic demand and sustained Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. demand from other regions outside Europe. In Asia, the value of sweet/sour crude differentials also increased with the Tapis premium over Dubai widening on a monthly average, despite a lower supply of sour crude from the Middle East. The Tapis/Dubai spread widened by 11¢ in January to reach $1.18/b, as domestic light sweet crudes became more competitive due to a narrow Brent-Dubai’s spread that stands at a discount of 3¢/b, narrowing 1¢ m-o-m. The Brent/Dubai Exchange of Futures for Swaps also widened slightly by 5¢/b on a monthly average in January to 91¢/b. The widening spread between light and heavy distillate margins in Asia also contributed to the widening crude sweet/sour spread. In the USGC, the Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) premium over medium sour Mars widened in January by 19¢/b, to $1.11/b, as increasing US refinery intakes; strengthening light distillate margins, like naphtha and gasoline; and maintaining US crude oil exports at about 3 mb/d in January added support to light sweet crude values in the USGC. Nonetheless, the LLS-Mars spread remains narrow compared to historical levels, as a tight global sour crude market buoyed the value of the sour crude value in the USGC. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodity prices started the year on a positive note, rising across the board led by an increase in oil prices for the third consecutive month. In general, overall financial market bullishness on expectations of additional government led stimulus was a supportive factor. Colder than average weather generally supported both natural gas and coal prices in Asia and Europe, with price gains in the US smaller in comparison due to milder January weather there. Base metals continued to rise, but at a slower pace than the previous month as the expansion in global manufacturing slowed slightly, especially in the largest consumer China. However, the positive sentiment in financial markets continued to be supportive. In the group of precious metals, gold prices showed a minor increase. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index advanced by around 10.0% m-o-m in January, with across the board increases in crude oil, natural gas and coal. In January 2021, the index was down by 7.1% compared with January 2020. The non-energy index rose m-o-m by 4.4%, mainly due to a 5.0% rise in agricultural commodity prices, while base metals prices rose by 1.1%. In January 2021, the non-energy index was up by 20% compared to January 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. In January, the Henry Hub natural gas index rose on average by 4.4% m-o-m to $2.7/mmbtu. Prices were supported by colder temperatures towards the end of the month, following a milder end to 2020 and the beginning of 2021. Moreover, there was an expectation that the cold weather pattern would continue at the start of February. In addition, according to IHS Markit, support also came from some small declines in domestic production, as well as strong demand for LNG exports, which was estimated slightly below 11 bcf/d – according to IHS Markit. As reported by the US Energy Information Administration, utilities withdrew 192 bcf from working gas underground storage during the week ending 29 January 2021. This withdrawal left total working gas in underground storage at 2,689 bcf, which was 7.9% above the latest five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe advanced strongly for the second consecutive month with the average Title Transfer Facility price up by 24.1% m-o-m to $7.3/mmbtu, almost twice the January 2020 price. Inventories declined significantly as a result of cold weather, while a further strengthening of Asia LNG prices, which averaged $17/mmbtu in January – briefly spiking above $30/mmbtu – continued to favour exports to that region instead of Europe. EU inventories ended January around 51.5% full, compared to a level of 74.1% at the end of December 2020, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Last year, inventories were around 71% full at the end of January. Australian thermal coal prices in January rose for the fifth consecutive month, increasing by 4.6% m-o-m to $86.8 mt – almost 25% higher than in January 2020. Similar to the previous month, colder than average winter temperatures in North East Asia, and the rising price of competitor fuel, such as natural gas, proved supportive. Back in December, in view of strong demand, due to colder than average weather and a strong economic performance, Chinese coal imports more than tripled m-o-m to $39.08 mln tonnes, while coal output in the country accelerated to 3.2% y-o-y in December, from 1.5% y-o-y in November. Meanwhile, thermal power generation jumped significantly in December 2020, up by 9.2% y-o-y, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

The pace of expansion in global manufacturing activity slowed from December 2020, especially in China, while the previous declining trend in the US dollar, which has been supportive of commodity prices in general, had some minor reversal. However, positive investor sentiment remained supportive, especially after more details of the possible size and composition of the new US fiscal stimulus package was outlined. Average monthly copper prices rose m-o-m in January by 2.6% to $7,972/Mt. This is 32% higher than in January 2020, supported by a further drop in stocks, overall investor bullishness and concerns about supply disruptions in major producer Peru. According to International Copper Study Group estimates, the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the January-to-October 2020 period showed a deficit of 380,000 tonnes versus 354,000 in the January-September estimation. Moreover, in January, inventories at London Metal Exchange (LME)-designated warehouses experienced another large drop to 74,575 tonnes, from 107,950 tonnes in December, signalling a tight copper market. Iron ore prices rose in January by 9.1% m-o-m to a monthly average of $169.6/mt, which is almost 77% higher than the January 2020 average. Prices have been supported by strong demand for steel making in China, which increased by 5.2% in 2020, compared to 2019, according to the World Steel Association. Chinese iron ore imports rose by 9.5% y-o-y in 2020. Concerns about Brazilian output due to COVID-19 and mine safety reviews also supported prices. In the group of precious metals, gold was up by 0.5% m-o-m in January. However, it dropped in the second half of the month from levels in the early part, as safe haven demand declined. Lower real interest rates towards the end of the month provided support. Silver prices meanwhile rose by 3.7% and platinum prices increased by 6.1%. Investment flows into commodities Money Managers’ net length increased moderately in crude oil and natural gas in absolute terms, and slightly as a share of the open interest (OI). Net length was reduced in copper and gold, both in absolute and relative terms.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 9 World Economy World Economy While the pandemic continues to dominate world economic developments, prospects for improvements in the containment of COVID-19 are rising. The global vaccination rollout is gaining pace, infection rates are falling in some areas, improvements in treatment and the growing use of rapid testing facilities all lend support to an acceleration of economic activity after 1Q21. Furthermore, additional large fiscal stimulus measures in the US and gains in key Asian economies are adding support to the recovery in 2021. Hence, the global economic growth forecast for 2021 was lifted to 4.8% from 4.4%. Considering the better-than-expected 2H20 growth numbers published recently, the 2020 GDP growth estimate was lifted to -3.9% from -4.1% in the previous month. On a quarterly basis, 1Q21 growth will still be considerably affected by ongoing lockdown measures, voluntary social distancing and other pandemicrelated developments. This may to some extent carry over into the 2Q21. However, by the end of 1H21, economic activity is forecast to significantly gain pace as the impact of the pandemic is expected to taper off. The momentum is then expected to be supported by pent-up demand, especially in the contact-intensive services sectors like tourism and travel, leisure and hospitality. The seasonal aspect of warm weather in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer travel season will add more support. Forced household savings from lockdowns, combined with ongoing monetary and likely additional fiscal stimulus, will add to the rebound. The base assumption for this scenario is that by 2H21, COVID-19 will largely be overcome. Depending on fiscal and monetary stimulus measures, especially the US, and the success of the COVID-19 containment efforts, further upside to the current global economic growth forecast may materialise. Nonetheless, numerous challenges remain, including COVID-19 variants and the effectiveness of vaccines against these mutations. Moreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates could cause severe fiscal strain. While not imminent, a further rise in inflation, especially in the US and the Euro-zone, may cause some tightening of monetary policies, an area that will need to be monitored in the short-term. Additionally, trade-related disputes, especially between the US and China, may continue. In greater detail, the OECD growth forecast for 2020 was revised up to -5.1%, after upward adjustments in the Euro-zone and some smaller OECD economies. OECD growth in 2021 is revised up to 3.9% from the previous month’s 3.5%, lifted in particular by improving growth expectations for the US, but also for the Euro-zone and Japan. In the emerging economies, India’s 2020 GDP growth was revised up to -8.2% from -9.0%. India’s growth forecast for 2021 was revised up to 7.5% from 6.8%. China’s GDP growth is revised up to the officially reported 2020 growth level of 2.3%. China’s growth forecast for 2021 was revised up to 7.4% from 6.9%. Brazil’s 2020 GDP growth forecast was revised up to -4.9% compared to -5.2% the previous month. The Brazilian economy is forecast to grow by 2.9% in 2021, an upward revision of 0.5 pp from the previous month. Russia’s 2020 GDP is -3.1%, the officially reported 2020 growth level, compared to the previous month’s growth estimate of -4.1%. Russia’s 2021 recovery was revised up slightly by 0.1 pp to 3.0%, with potentially some further upside in connection with the ongoing DoC process.

Ongoing lockdowns in many Western economies are dampening the economic recovery in 1Q21, while Asian economies seem have gained further pace, but are also still very much impacted by the pandemic. Looking at updates on growth in the OECD, the Euro-zone reported better-than-expected 2H20 growth, lowering the GDP decline in 2020. The US has proposed further fiscal stimulus measures, and Japan seems to continue benefitting of improvements in global trade. In the emerging and developing economies, China has reported better-than-expected growth in 4Q20, lifting 2020 FY growth and making it the only major economy to expand in 2020. While India experienced a significant economic decline in 1H20, the economy appears to have improved in 2H20, momentum that is expected to continue in 2021, especially with the broad-based stimulus measures that were announced recently. On a global level, the recovery momentum was led by the manufacturing sector, while the contactintensive services sectors are still impacted by the consequences of the global pandemic. Travel and tourism, leisure and hospitality are all sectors that have hardly gained global momentum, thus very much affecting oildemand. After the approval of an additional stimulus package of around $900 billion at the turn of the year, the new US administration is proposing additional stimulus of up to $1.9 trillion. In the Euro-zone, the approval of the 750-billion-euro fund at the end of last year will also provide a sound pillar for momentum going forward. These large fiscal stimulus packages have certainly lifted debt levels to very high levels, which will require close monitoring in the near term. Global trade levels continued improving, according Graph 3 1: Global trade to data available up to November.

Near-term expectations The base assumption for the near-term is that COVID-19 will be largely contained by 2H21. Current pandemicrelated challenges are considered to be temporary, as the distribution of vaccines is forecast to gain traction and this should lead to a recovery gaining pace towards the end of 2Q21. Economic growth in 1Q21 is still forecast to be largely affected by the ongoing rise in infections, the consequent lockdown measures and voluntary social distancing. Importantly, it is forecast that the recovery will be significantly supported by a rebound in contact-intensive sectors, especially in travel and tourism, leisure and hospitality. The improving outlook will very much be supported by pent-up demand that will be driven by relatively high forced household savings during the lockdown periods, especially in Western economies, and the large monetary and fiscal stimulus measures. The seasonal aspect of warm weather in the Northern Hemisphere and the travel season at that time will provide additional support. Rising investment will provide an additional pillar to growth as well. New COVID-19 variants, and concern that existing vaccines may be less effective against the new mutations, are the major risks to the expected recovery.

However, momentum will gain traction towards the end of 2Q21 and is forecast to pick up in 2H21. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments Growth of the US economy in 4Q20 was reported at 4% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR), as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). While a slowdown was expected, it marks a significant deceleration from GDP growth of 33.4% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q20. The slower pace of growth stemmed from an ongoing rise in infections and the gridlock of the presidential elections delaying further social welfare support after most programmes ended in 3Q20. Sentiment improved in January following the approval in late 2020 of a $900 billion stimulus package and the new US administration’s proposal for $1.9 trillion in additional support. Consumer confidence rose in January to 89.3 compared to 87.1 in December, as measured by the Conference Board. This improvement in sentiment has not become visible yet in the latest available retail sales data. Retail sales retracted in value terms with growth rate of 2.3% in December, compared to 4.2% y-o-y in November. One positive aspect for future consumption is that the important equity and housing markets continued to perform well, largely supported by monetary stimulus with the Fed raising its balance sheet volume by more than $3 trillion in 2020. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 World Economy US industrial sector activity improved in December, Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market contracting by 3.6% y-o-y, compared to a decline of % % 5.2% y-o-y in November.

Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations With additional stimulus measures likely to be implemented soon, growth is forecast to be well supported in 2021. Although the US administration proposed a fiscal support package of $1.9 trillion, it is likely to be lower, but even the magnitude of an expected $1.5 trillion would account for more than 7% of US GDP. The additional support on top of the $900 billion package approved in December and the ongoing monetary stimulus are very likely to counterbalance any negative impact in 1Q21 of ongoing COVID-19-related challenges. While 1Q21 is forecast to remain impacted by social-distancing measures, holding GDP growth at 2.2% q-o-q SAAR, growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.5% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21 and to around 5% SAAR on a quarterly average in 2H21, led by consumer spending and investment. Positively, effective containment, in combination with well-targeted stimulus measures, could further lift the current 2021 growth forecast. This may push up inflation, so that in the case of a significant spike in US economic growth in 2H20, the Fed may consider tapering its monetary stimulus with a potential dampening effect on the recovery. Rising debt levels and the associated debt services may then also cause fiscal constraints going forward. These factors will require close monitoring, but are not expected to pose an imminent challenge. The economy’s recovery is reflected in December Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and PMI levels as provided by the Institute for Supply non-manufacturing indices Management (ISM), indicating an ongoing pick-up in Index the coming months, albeit the manufacturing index 65 retracted slightly.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 13 World Economy OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments Euro-zone FY 2020 GDP growth was reported at -6.8% after a better-than-expected 2H20 recovery. This came after strong growth of 59.9% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q20 and a decline of -2.8% q-o-q in 4Q20. The decline in 4Q20 was less than expected, despite the ongoing lockdown measures in most Euro-zone economies. Given the strong support measures that were enacted by Euro-zone governments, in combination with fiscal support from the EU and monetary support from the ECB, the situation has somewhat stabilised as can be seen in the labour market, which so far has been largely subsided.

Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations Although large parts of the Euro-zone were under lockdown, in 4Q20 the decline was less than expected and it seems that despite the ongoing challenges, the situation has somewhat stabilised in 1Q21. Quarterly growth in 1Q21 will be relatively low, but growth is forecast to gain speed towards mid-year. The ECB’s additional monetary stimulus, in combination with the distribution of the EU’s 750-billion-euro rescue fund, will help support the gradual recovery in 2021. While 1Q21 is forecast to remain affected by COVID-19-related socialdistancing measures, holding GDP growth at 1.2% q-o-q SAAR, growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.8% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21 and to almost 6% SAAR on a quarterly average in 2H21. Growth is to be led by consumer spending, investment and a rise in exports. The underlying assumptions are that the distribution Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs of vaccines is gaining pace and that the extension of Index rapid testing facilities will support the gradual 60 54.8 normalisation of social activities with a consequent 50 positive effect on the travel and transportation, leisure 45.4 and hospitality sectors.

By the end of 2Q21, growth should gain traction with an anticipated improvement in the COVID-19 situation amid the expected wide availability of vaccines. With the prospect for successful containment of COVID-19 and further improvements in the global economy providing upside support, the 2021 GDP growth forecast was revised up to 4.1% from 3.7% in the previous month. OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments Indicators from January and the end of 2020 show that the Japanese economy is facing a slow recovery following very strong 3Q20 growth. After a decline of 2.1% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q20 and a contraction of 29.2% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q20, growth recovered to 22.9% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q20. Domestic activity remains sluggish and has been recently affected by recent lockdown measures, especially in Tokyo, with emergency measures extended until 7 March. While these measures have continuously depressed the level of activity in the services sector, the industrial sector has performed relatively better, also supported by the recovery in global trade. Japan’s exports have picked up in recent months – up to November – and have provided support to the Japanese economy. While industrial production (IP) had improved on a monthly basis up to October, the latest available numbers from November and especially from December show a declining trend. IP fell by 0.3% m-o-m in November and 1.3% m-o-m in December. This compares to growth of more than 3% in both October and September. Similarly, exports recovered up to November, fuelled Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports by a rebound in global trade, but retracted in % change y-o-y November and December.

Retail sales growth slowed again as well, declining by 0.3% y-o-y in December, after growing by 0.6% y-o-y in November and 6.4% y-o-y in October. In line with the economy’s domestic slowdown, consumer sentiment, as reported by the Cabinet Office, stood at 30.1 in January, a considerable decline from an already low level in December, when the index stood at 32.2. Near-term expectations After the sharp rebound of 22.9% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q20, growth expectations for Japan’s economy are forecast to have slowed in 4Q20 to 4.6% q-o-q SAAR. Strong enforcement of the rules under the emergency statue are expected to lead to an ongoing depressed level of mobility, keeping domestic economic activity at rather low levels, especially in the services sector in 1Q21. The ongoing measures will cut growth in 1Q21 to around OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 15 World Economy zero, while a strong rebound is expected by 2Q21, leading to quarterly growth for the remaining three quarters of the calendar year of around 4% q-o-q SAAR.

As a result, 2021 GDP growth has been revised up slightly to stand at 2.9%, compared to 2.8% in the previous month. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s real GDP expanded 6.5% y-o-y in 4Q20, up from 4.9% y-o-y in 3Q20, bringing the economy back to pre-pandemic growth rates. China’s real GDP expanded by 2.3% in 2020, making it the only major economy to avoid a contraction last year, although this marked the lowest growth rate since 1976. The recent growth level was driven by a combination of factors, including investment in infrastructure and real estate and the resilient export sector, which was boosted by the strong global demand for medical supplies and equipment. Despite the steady pick-up in private consumption, growth was below expectations due to the fears of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. Comparing 4Q20 to 3Q20, the primary sector grew by 4.1% y-o-y compared to 3.9% y-o-y, while the secondary sector grew by 6.8% y-o-y, slightly up from 6.0% y-o-y, and services expanded by 6.7% y-o-y compared to 4.3% y-o-y. Regarding the GDP contribution from demand, final consumption expenditure demand contracted by only 0.5% y-o-y in 4Q20 compared to 2.2% y-o-y. Gross capital formation expanded by only 2.2 y-o-y in 4Q20 following growth of 2.5% y-o-y in 3Q20.

China’s retail sales grew only by 4.6% y-o-y in December 2020, following a 5.0% gain in November, reflecting the weakness in consumption. For 2020 retail sales dropped by about 3.9% compared to 2019, the first contraction since 1968. Online retail sales grew by about 11% y-o-y in 4Q20 compared to 9.7% y-o-y in 3Q20; still it was below the gain of 16.5% y-o-y in 4Q19. The recent economic data could mean that the policy support offered to the economy during the peak of the pandemic would be normalized in 2021, mainly through reductions in monetary easing. In such a case, policymakers might consciously need to restart economic reforms without effecting the ongoing growth. Recently, the State Council extended its measures on supporting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) which shows that policymakers are still cautious about the pace of the recovery.

Near-term expectations COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, concerted health policies and government financial support are expected to underpin India’s ongoing economic recovery. Naturally, the recovery would be faster if vaccines were rolled out quicker, as this would boost confidence among consumers and businesses and reduce uncertainty. India has been relatively proactive in securing vaccines. Moreover, Indian producers control about 60% of the world's total supply of vaccines of all types, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This means those producers may give more priority to local vaccine needs. For the time being, business confidence in India is tilted more towards the positive as the economy continues to recover amid the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions. The PMI indices reflected that as the Composite PMI Graph 3 15: India’s PMIs index rose to 55.80 points in January from 54.90 in Index December 2020 while the IHS Markit India 60 57.7 55.8 Manufacturing PMI rose to 57.7 in January 2021 52.8 from 56.4 in the previous month.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 19 World Economy Yet there is a high level of uncertainty about the country’s short-term economic outlook as delays to vaccination deployment and difficulties controlling new virus outbreaks might hinder the recovery.

Latin America Brazil Update on latest developments Despite the negative outlook over the spike in COVID-19 cases, Brazil's recovery continued in 4Q20, following a third-quarter rebound. Recent key indicators suggest further improvement, especially in labour market. The unemployment rate declined to 14.1% in November 2020 from 14.4% in October 2020. The number of unemployed rose by 1.7% to 14.02 million and employment increased by 4.8% to 85.58 million. The labour force participation rate increased by 1.9 pp to 56.6%. Meanwhile industrial production advanced 8.2% y-o-y in December 2020, the most since April 2018, following growth of 2.6% y-o-y in November. The services sector, which accounts for about 70% of Brazil's GDP and is heavily affected by COVID-19, continued to recover according to November IBGE data, growing by a better-than-expected 2.6% m-o-m (seasonally adjusted), although it was still down by 4.3% y-o-y. Inflationary pressures increased as the consumer Graph 3 16: Brazil’s inflation vs. interest rate price inflation rate rose to 4.56% y-o-y in January % change y-o-y % per annum 2021, mainly due to upward pressure from food and 6 6 beverages and housing prices.

Near-term expectations Brazil economic outlook for 2021 depends upon the trajectory of the pandemic and availability of COVID-19 vaccines for a sizable share of the population. Meanwhile, the impetus for economic reforms following the election in early February probably would boost prospects for progress on public-sector reforms in 2021. 20 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 World Economy In the meantime, the Industrial Entrepreneur Graph 3 17: Brazil’s PMIs Confidence Index in Brazil declined to 60.9 in January Index 2020 from 63.1 in the previous month.

Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments Despite the continued risks of the new rise of COVID-19 infections, the most recent macroeconomic indicators suggested that South Africa’s modest recovery is more robust. In 4Q20 exports gained momentum, increasing by about 20% y-o-y. Imports declined by 3% y-o-y, suggesting a quicker pace of trade activity. Overall, in 2020 exports increased by 7.5% to R1.39 trn (US$83.9 bn) and imports declined by 11.8% to R1.12 trn, resulting in an unprecedentedly large surplus of R270bn, compared to R24bn in 2019. Moreover, according to the South African Reserve Bank, public and private external debt dropped by 11.7% y-o-y to US$156.9 bn in 3Q20 due to the depreciation of the rand, in which a significant proportion of external borrowing is denominated. Randdenominated foreign debt typically accounts for about 50% of external obligations and naturally those obligations become lower when the rand is weaker. Industrial production dropped 3.5% y-o-y in November 2020, following a 3.4% y-o-y decline in the previous month. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, industrial production shrank 1.3%, compared to a 3.2% increase in October 2020. Labour market conditions worsened as the unemployment rate surged to 30.8% in 3Q20 from 23.3% in 2Q20, the highest jobless rate since 2008. The number of job-seekers surged amid the easing of lockdown restrictions and increased by 2.2 million to 6.5 million, though employment rose by 543,000 to 14.7 million and the labour force jumped by 2.8 million to 21.2 million. Near-term expectations The outlook for South African economic growth in 2021 remains highly uncertain. Nevertheless, the postpandemic programme that the government committed to in exchange for rapid IMF financing will prioritise investment, job creation and power supply. This could add impetus to reform the economy and in turn support the recovery. As with other countries, South Africa’s economic recovery is highly dependent on vaccination developments and a sizable share of the country’s population might not be vaccinated until the end of 2021. Nonetheless, the global expansion of vaccinations could support external demand and trade. Moreover, South Africa's Absa Manufacturing PMI increased slightly to 50.9 in January 2021 from 50.3 in December.

Russia and Central Asia Russia Update on the latest developments Russia's economy contracted 3.1% y-o-y in 2020, compared to 2% y-o-y growth in 2019, according to the first full-year estimate published by the Federal State Statistics Service. This represents a mild contraction compared to most of the consensus expectations, including the decline of 3.9% projected by Russia’s central bank. The less sever contraction is mainly driven by the improvement in oil price supported by the sequence of OPEC+ through the DoC decisions. Moreover, the released growth rate may not reflect the terms-of-trade shock as imports tend to contract much more sharply than exports, causing net exports to rise in y-o-y terms. Indeed, exports fell by 5.1% y-o-y in 2020; however, imports fell much further, by 13.7% y-o-y. Consequently, net exports recorded a positive contribution to the GDP. Household consumption fell by 8.6%. The government’s spending contribution was also significant, although more limited than other advanced economies. The IMF estimates that government stimulus, including direct fiscal support, state guarantees and extra-budgetary measures, was equivalent to 4.5% of GDP. Overall, the 2020 GDP contraction was the sharpest annual contraction since 2009 amid the novel COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in global demand for energy resources. Russia’s other high frequency macroeconomic indicators continued to show a robust recovery despite the rise in COVID-19 infections. Industrial production rose 4.4% in December 2020 over the same month in the previous year. The labour market improved as well, the unemployment rate fell to 5.9% in December 2020 from 6.1% in the previous month. Nevertheless, retail sales in Russia declined 3.6% y-o-y in December 2020, following a 3.1% fall in the previous month. Yet, on a monthly basis, retail trade rose 17.3% following a 1.2% drop in November. Russia's consumer price inflation rate increased to Graph 3 18: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate 5.2% y-o-y in January 2021, from 4.9% y-o-y in % December 2020, the sharpest rate rise since April 8 2019 as prices for both food products advanced 0.4%.

This was the sixth consecutive quarterly contraction but the smallest since 4Q19 because the easing of lockdown measures. On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the GDP expanded by 2.8% after a 1.8% expansion in 3Q20. For the full year, the economy contracted by 4.1%, reversing from growth of 0.3% in 2019. The forward-looking PMI index increased to 57.1 in January 2021 from 57.0 in December, pointing to the highest reading since November 2019. Overall, as the Saudi economy recovered further from the COVID-19 outbreak, the non-oil industrial output is now expanding and the recovery in 2021 is more robust. More importantly, the ongoing recovery is supported by the improvement in oil prices. Nigeria The meaningful rise in oil prices following the recent DoC decisions, along with a positive trajectory from COVID-19 vaccines, could brighten the 2021 outlook and lay the groundwork for a hopeful medium-term real GDP expansion. Moreover recent data showed that consumer confidence in Nigeria increased to -14.80 points in 4Q20 from -21.20 points in 3Q20. However, recent Central Bank of Nigeria composite PMI for the manufacturing sector edged down to 49.6 in December 2020 from 50.2 in November, signalling a renewed contraction in the country's manufacturing activity. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Extensive stimulus measures have helped sustain the economy during the COVID-19 crisis, and the vaccine rollout provides further optimism considering the rapid progress on immunizations. However, the recovery in 2021 is highly dependent on the oil price improvement, which is central to a strong business environment and economic recovery. The UAE’s non-oil PMI stayed unchanged at 51.2 in January 2021, though it recorded the second straight expansion in the private sector, amid success in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Business sentiment improved to the highest in three months, adding to the positive economic outlook for 2021.

Oil demand is estimated to have declined by 9.7 mb/d y-o-y in 2020, to average 90.3 mb/d. In the OECD, demand contraction in 2020 was revised up by more than 0.1 mb/d compared to last month’s projection, to show a drop of around 5.7 mb/d. In the non-OECD, the demand decline was revised lower, m-o-m, by more than 0.1 mb/d leading to an estimated drop of around 4.1 mb/d. For 2021, positive developments were evident across major economies, specifically in the US, supporting demand for petroleum products, particularly industrial fuels. The majority of this positive economic impact is assumed to gain traction during 2H21. However, this positive outlook was counterbalanced by expectations for a weaker recovery in transportation fuels in 1H21. COVID-19 infection cases remain high in regions such as the US, Europe and Latin America, which has led to governments imposing new lockdown measures, or deepening existing ones, to help control the spread of the virus. Additionally, a slower rollout of vaccinations is assumed to further delay herd immunity targets in some countries and regions, and the appearance of new variants in many countries has only added to the uncertainties. Nevertheless, stronger growth is anticipated from transportation fuels in 2H21, based on the assumption that vaccination programmes will help stem the spread of COVID-19 and that the announced massive stimulus programmes will have a positive impact. As a result, OECD oil demand is forecast to grow by 2.5 mb/d in 2021. In the non-OECD region, oil demand for the year is estimated to increase by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y, supported by a rebound in economic activities in the main economies, particularly China, India and Other Asia. Consequently, world oil demand growth in 2021 is revised lower by 0.1 mb/d to 5.8 mb/d y-o-y.

OECD OECD Americas Update on the latest developments A continuation of poor gasoline performance in OECD Graph 4 1: OECD Americas oil demand, y-o-y Americas resulted in a 2.6 mb/d y-o-y decline in oil change demand in November. This compares to a 3.0 mb/d, mb/d y-o-y drop in October. However, light distillates continued to perform positively y-o-y. Gasoline 6 demand was predominantly impacted by COVID-19 4 restriction measures in a number of states with a notable reduction in miles travelled in the US. Diesel 2 also registered a drop, almost matching the October 0 decrease, with declines in industrial diesel marginally -2 offset by increasing heating fuel requirements, especially in Canada. The magnitude of the oil -4 demand decline in Canada has improved, with a -6 y-o-y drop of 0.2 mb/d in November, compared to around a 0.6 mb/d y-o-y decrease in October.

Note: * 1Q21-4Q21 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. In November, sluggish gasoline demand negatively impacted oil demand in the US. Gasoline and jet fuel dropped by a combined 1.8 mb/d y-o-y, following a similar drop in October. The vehicle-miles travelled indicator exhibited a y-o-y decline of around 9.0%, again similar to the drop in October, according to the Federal Highway Administration. An uptick in COVID-19 infection cases and subsequent reduction in mobility – given the closure of restaurants, cinemas and leisure centres – and the implementation of teleworking and remote school learning, have all negatively impacted transportation fuel demand. Total US airline traffic remained in a steep decline at the beginning of the 4Q20, posting a y-o-y a drop of more than 60% in October, mostly due to a reduction in international airline traffic, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A similar trend is anticipated for the reminder of the 4Q20. Diesel performance showed a y-o-y decline of 0.3 mb/d in November, compared to a 0.2 mb/d drop in October. The US Industrial sector was impacted by a slowdown in economic activity in November, with industrial activity dropping by 5.5% y-o-y following a decline of 5.0% in October. 26 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 3: US oil demand, mb/d Change 2020/19 Nov 20 Nov 19 mb/d % By product LPG 3.41 3.26 0.15 4.6 Naphtha 0.18 0.18 0.00 0.5 Gasoline 7.98 9.21 -1.23 -13.4 Jet/kerosene 1.13 1.72 -0.59 -34.4 Diesel 3.89 4.20 -0.31 -7.4 Fuel oil 0.21 0.21 0.00 -0.5 Other products 2.19 2.24 -0.05 -2.1 Total 18.99 21.03 -2.03 -9.7 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: EIA and OPEC. Near-term expectations Stimulus measures are assumed to aid a rebound in economic activity. Hence, oil consumption is estimated to increase y-o-y with the bulk of the gains expected in the 2H21. The latest COVID-19 related developments, as well as the speed of vaccination programmes, provide some source of optimism. However, uncertainties remain across many sectors, particularly transportation and most notably aviation. The rebound will depend on the impact of COVID-19 containment measures and how fast herd immunity targets are reached. Additionally, labour market developments are anticipated to have a significant impact on gasoline demand. Gasoline and diesel are estimated to lead demand growth in 2021, together with petrochemical feedstocks which are anticipated to show growth amid recovering economic activity and healthy capacity developments. Anticipated gains in oil consumption in 2021 will not be at a level to match pre-COVID-19 demand, mainly due to the lagging aviation sector and the structural impact on consumer behaviour post-COVID-19. Moreover, continuing efficiency gains, as well as substitution programs, are expected to weigh on demand for oil petroleum product demand in the transportation sector. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments In OECD Europe, demand for oil posted an Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y accelerated steeper decline in November compared change to October. Oil demand recorded a y-o-y drop of mb/d 2.0 mb/d in November after a decline of 1.6 mb/d in 4 October, a difference of 0.4 mb/d. Worsening mobility data in light of the reintroduction of restriction 2 measures in many of the region’s countries has further pressured demand for transportation fuels. Demand for gasoline shrunk by 0.4 mb/d y-o-y in 0 November, compared to a drop of 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in October. The majority of the decline occurred in the -2 largest consuming economies of France, the UK, Italy and Germany, with the former two countries -4 accounting for more than 0.1 mb/d of the estimated decline. 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* Note: * 1Q21-4Q21 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. Diesel was also impacted by mobility restrictions, as on-road diesel accounts for more than 70% of the demand for the product, recording a drop of 0.8 mb/d, which is almost double the level of decline registered in October. In France, diesel demand during November declined the most y-o-y, down 0.2 mb/d, following a y-o-y decline of 0.1 mb/d in October. The UK and Germany each recorded a y-o-y decline of more than 0.1 mb/d in November. According to the Association des Constructeurs Europeans d’Automobiles and Haver Analytics, new vehicle registrations posted a steeper y-o-y decline in November compared to October. The index showed a drop of 24.0% y-o-y in November, following a y-o-y decline of 19.3% in October. According to preliminary data, the index dropped in 2020 for the first time since 2014, posting a record high y-o-y decline of 33.7%.

Jet fuel demand in OECD Europe declined by around 0.8 mb/d y-o-y in November, after posting a y-o-y drop of around 1.0 mb/d in October. The increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and the associated restrictions introduced in various economies slowed the recovery progress in air travel. OECD Europe was one of the most severely impacted regions as a result of stringent containment measures. According to International Air Transport Association (IATA), international revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) dropped by 87% y-o-y in November, following a drop of 83% in October. Near-term expectations Mobility restrictions and travel bans across many countries in the region on the back of new COVID-19 variants, such as those that were first registered in the UK and South Africa, are assumed to negatively affect 1Q21 oil demand projections compared to last month’s assessment. As such, oil demand in 2021 was adjusted lower due to government’s re-imposing partial or strict lockdowns that impact 1H21 oil consumption estimates. Service sectors in many countries, such as hospitality and tourism, are shutting down either partially or fully and thus reducing fuel consumption. Transportation fuels are assumed to be impacted the most, while industrial fuels are assumed to be affected less. The performance of petrochemical feedstocks is a positive contributor for oil demand in light of the steady requirements from health and other sectors. Moreover, the continued use of teleworking and home schooling will weigh on transportation fuel consumption in 2021. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments In OECD Asia-Pacific, oil demand dropped sharply Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y in November by 0.8 mb/d, compared to a y-o-y change decline of 0.7 mb/d in October. Japan led the declines mb/d as y-o-y demand shrunk by more than 0.3 mb/d, most 0.8 of which was related to transportation fuels. Gasoline and jet fuel dropped by more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 0.4 November after declining by similar levels in October on the back of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 0.0 In South Korea, a reduction in light distillate -0.4 requirements dominated the picture, weakening the country’s overall demand. In November, declines in -0.8 naphtha reached almost 0.3 mb/d y-o-y, compared to -1.2 a y-o-y drop of 0.1 mb/d in October.

Sources: JODI and OPEC. In Australia, y-o-y consumption remained in decline at around 0.2 mb/d in November, with most of the losses attributed to the reduction in jet fuel consumption. Dwindling international flight traffic is assumed to pressure jet fuel requirements in the country and is not expected to show any meaningful recovery in the near future. Initial data for the month of December, as reported by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), indicate a y-o-y decline of 0.18 mb/d, compared to a 0.3 mb/d y-o-y fall in November. Near-term expectations Oil demand in OECD Asia Pacific in 2021 is projected to rise for the first time in seven years. The historically low demand performance in 2020, in addition to improving economic momentum, are foreseen to contribute positively to oil demand in 2021. However, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Japan and South Korea, along with government attempts to control the further spread, are assumed to negatively impact fuel consumption in the 1Q21 compared to last month’s assessment. Some spill over affects are now assumed to also affect 2Q21 estimates. Uncertainties are high and clouding projections, especially related to the COVID-19 pandemic development and vaccination rollouts. For the rest of 2021, oil demand is anticipated to be led by healthier petrochemical sector demand and an overall positive industrial sector performance compared to last year. Needless to say, jet fuel requirements in the aviation sector are not anticipated to reach 2019 levels due to the reduced level of international business and leisure travel. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments December oil demand data indicates y-o-y growth of Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change more than 0.4 mb/d, compared to y-o-y growth of mb/d around 0.8 mb/d in November. Petrochemical 2 feedstock, led by naphtha, expanded the most, adding around 0.5 mb/d y-o-y. Naphtha was supported by 1 healthy and rising cracker margins that hovered around $680 per ton in December. LPG benefited 0 from high LNG prices, as well as strong demand from the residential sector for heating purposes. -1 Gasoline demand increased for the second-2 consecutive month, up by around 0.2 mb/d y-o-y, amid improving mobility and increasing motor vehicle -3 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* sales.

Jet fuel demand also posted y-o-y gains of 0.1 mb/d, following an increase in air travel volumes. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 29 World Oil Demand Looking at data for 2020, oil demand appears to have declined by more than 0.4 mb/d compared to 2019. The bulk of the decline was recorded in 1Q20 amid the onset of COVID-19, which reduced oil consumption, particularly for gasoline and jet fuel. The 1Q20 oil demand data indicates a historic decline of 2.0 mb/d compared with the same period in 2019. However, improvements in oil demand were registered in 2Q20, which showed a lesser decline of around 0.5 mb/d compared to the same quarter in 2019. The 2H20 showed China’s oil demand returning to growth, largely due to a reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases and an uptick in economic activities. In terms of products, weakness was seen in transportation fuels, particularly jet fuel, which declined substantially by around 0.3 mb/d in 2020 compared to 2019. Reduction in air travel activities during the pandemic and the struggle for the sector to improve since impacted jet fuel demand and its recovery in 2020, particularly for international flights.

Gasoline was also affected by the economic slowdown in 1Q20, but showed improvement thereafter. Overall, gasoline demand fell by 0.2 mb/d in 2020 compared to 2019 levels. Diesel declined by around 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, compared to 2019. However, the product recovered steadily from the 2Q20 onward, propelled by improving economic indicators including a steadily recovering industrial sector. LPG and naphtha outperformed expectations and recorded y-o-y gains in 2020. LPG demand registered marginal y-o-y growth, while naphtha posted gains of more than 0.1 mb/d compared to 2019, propelled by capacity additions, as well as healthy cracking margins. Near-term expectations In China, oil demand is projected to show growth in 2021 driven by a rebound in economic activity and the low baseline of 2020. The main economic sectors are anticipated to show a positive recovery led by the transportation, petrochemical and industrial sectors. Oil demand estimates for 2021 are based on a y-o-y increase in gasoline demand propelled by developments in the economy, rising vehicle sales compared to 2020, and improving vehicles miles travelled. Diesel demand is also anticipated to show positive growth in 2021, due to developments in industrial, construction and agriculture activity, as well as the low baseline for 2020. Moreover, demand for LPG and naphtha is anticipated to record positive gains, due to healthy petrochemical margins and recent capacity development. India Update on the latest developments Demand in India declined y-o-y for the second-consecutive month in December, dropping by 0.05 mb/d. This follows a larger decline of 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y in November. However, the main economic indicators showed steady progress over the 4Q20. The IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI posted an increase of 56.4 in December 2020, a slight rise from 56.3 in the previous month. This showed a consistent improvement in business conditions that continued to be a positive supportive factor for industrial fuels. Diesel declined slightly, y-o-y, in December, compared to a y-o-y drop of 0.1 mb/d in November. Additionally, vehicle registration increased by 9.7% y-o-y amid the recent steady progress in mobility indicators with public mobility showing an increase of around 90% towards the end of the year. Manufacturing activities also saw an uptick towards the end of 2020. 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 World Oil Demand A quick review of India’s 2020 oil demand data shows Graph 4 5: India’s oil demand, y-o-y change a decline of 0.5 mb/d compared to 2019, with diesel mb/d recording the steepest decline, followed by jet 2 kerosene and gasoline. In contrast, LPG showed a positive increase on the back of gains in residential 1 usage throughout the year. The second quarter registered the largest demand decline ever recorded 0 in India with a drop of 1.2 mb/d compared to a year earlier, mainly due to the stringent lockdown and mobility restriction measures to combat the spread of -1 COVID-19, which severely impacted demand for petroleum fuels as a result. For industrial fuels, slower -2 momentum in industrial, construction, and agriculture sectors have negatively impacted demand for 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21* 2Q21* 3Q21* 4Q21* industrial fuels.

Source: OPEC. compared to 2019 levels, while fuel oil and the other products category – which includes bitumen for road construction – collectively fell by more than 0.1 mb/d compared to 2019. Limits on mobility and a major drop in air activities during the pandemic impacted transportation fuels, particularly gasoline and jet fuel. Gasoline declined by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2020, while jet kerosene also posted a drop of 0.1 mb/d compared with the same period in 2019. It is important to highlight that jet/kerosene also includes kerosene used for home cooking, which has been under structural decline due to the government’s pledge to replace kerosene with LPG for home cooking. Consequently, LPG demand was higher y-o-y in 2020 by around 0.04 mb/d. Petrochemical feedstock, mainly naphtha, posted marginal positive growth in 2020, especially towards the end of the year, taking advantage of healthy naphtha cracking margins.

Sources: JODI, Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of India and OPEC. Near-term expectations In 2021, in light of an anticipated robust rebound in economic activity, oil demand is projected to bounce back swiftly. This increase is a reflection of positive policy measures promoting increases in private consumption and investment. Taken together with the low 2020 baseline, oil demand is projected to record a historic increase in 2021. Demand for transportation fuel is estimated to lead product demand followed by middle distillates. Other Asia Update on the latest developments Oil demand growth in Other Asia was lower by around 0.7 mb/d y-o-y in November, following a similar drop in October. Demand declined mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, with jet kerosene and diesel the products recording the largest drops. Jet kerosene, led by jet fuel, dropped by 0.5 mb/d y-o-y, following a similar decline in October. The aviation sector has been struggling to recover, particularly given the drop off in international flights. Reduced international travel for leisure and business has affected jet fuel demand in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, all of which are well-established tourist destinations. Jet fuel demand y-o-y dropped by 0.2 mb/d in Indonesia, and around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in both Thailand and Malaysia. Diesel barely made an improvement in the level of decline between October and November, falling by around OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 31 World Oil Demand 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in both months. Most of the weakness appeared in Malaysia, where demand for diesel declined by around 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in November, following a similar drop in October. Malaysia’s construction sector appears to be struggling to recover on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic. Suspensions, delays and project cost overruns were common in Malaysia in 2020, and the challenges were exacerbated by about 4,000 COVID-19 infections recorded at various worksites towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Negara Malaysia and Haver Analytics, new construction permits dropped by 69.6% y-o-y in November, following a y-o-y decline of 32.8% in October. Near-term expectations Looking ahead, oil demand is anticipated to improve y-o-y in 2021. Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines are anticipated to account for most of these gains during the current year, with the transportation sector anticipated to lead oil demand growth. Gasoline is projected to support transportation fuels growth, followed by on-road diesel. Demand for industrial fuels, diesel and fuel oil, will be highly dependent on the recovery in economic activities in 2021. Latin America Update on the latest developments In November, y-o-y oil demand dropped further by Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y around 0.3 mb/d, after declining by around 0.2 mb/d change y-o-y in both September and October. Transportation mb/d fuels remained the primary reason for the declines as 0.9 the performance of gasoline and jet fuel worsened. 0.6 Gasoline and jet fuel each recorded a drop of around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, while diesel posted a y-o-y drop of 0.3 around 0.05 mb/d. This follows y-o-y drops in October 0.0 of around 0.05 mb/d for gasoline and 0.02 mb/d for -0.3 diesel. Jet fuel decline levels y-o-y have remained -0.6 constant around 0.1 mb/d since August 2020.

Industrial production in Brazil rose by 2.8% y-o-y in November, following a 0.3% increase in October. Brazilian oil demand marginally increased by 0.05 mb/d in December, expanding for the first time since January 2020. Positive increases were witnessed in industrial fuels, coupled with encouraging developments in the transportation sector. Gasoline demand grew amid price advantage over ethanol.

Most countries are anticipated to record healthy growth, with Brazil leading the region. In terms of products, middle distillates, led by diesel, are expected to record the highest growth, followed by gasoline, supported by the recovering transportation sector. The outlook depends considerably on COVID-19 developments and vaccine availability. Positive developments on the vaccine front should encourage a faster recovery in economic activity, along with improvements in mobility, lending support to transportation and industrial fuels. Middle East Update on the latest developments In November, y-o-y oil demand in the Middle East shrunk by 0.2 mb/d, after dropping by more than 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in October. Most countries exhibited positive improvements in the level of the decline. Transportation fuels remained affected by the pandemic as jet fuel and gasoline each dropped by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. Restrictions on international travel and a significant reduction in domestic flights continued to halt any meaningful recovery in jet fuel demand. Furthermore, gasoline remained impacted by less miles travelled and, despite an easing in mobility restriction measures, gasoline has yet to show any significant recovery. The decline in diesel y-o-y improved marginally in line with an uptick in construction and trucking activities in Saudi Arabia. Cement deliveries increased by 15.4% y-o-y in November, as reported by the Yamama Cement Company and Haver Analytics. This further indicates a continuation of the positive trend in the construction sector. In terms of countries, demand in Saudi Arabia posted a y-o-y increase of around 0.1 mb/d as highlighted in last month report, while demand dropped in every other country in the region, led by Iraq and IR of Iran, which collectively declined by around 0.3 mb/d y-o-y. In December, oil demand in Saudi Arabia flipped back Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change to a declining trend after posting y-o-y gains in mb/d November.

However, the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases is still a major downside risk despite the recent rollout of vaccination programs in many countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait. Encouraging developments in infrastructure projects, in addition to improving requirements for power generation, is expected to offer support to industrial fuels. The economic outlook is anticipated to recover strongly from last year, supporting demand for all petroleum products. In terms of products, middle distillates are projected to return to solid growth propelled by strong demand from the industrial and construction sectors. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply for 2020 is revised down by 0.05 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment, and is now forecast to contract by 2.54 mb/d (including processing gains) to average 62.66 mb/d. This month’s estimation accounts for lower-than-expected production in 4Q20 in Brazil and Thailand, while Canada’s production was revised up. US liquids production in November 2020 was higher by 0.73 mb/d m-o-m to average 17.60 mb/d, mainly due to the recovery from production outages in October in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), following hurricanes Delta and Zeta. The non-OPEC countries showing the largest supply declines in 2020 are expected to be Russia, the US, Canada, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Malaysia, the UK and Azerbaijan, while oil production increases are estimated mainly in Norway, Brazil, China and Guyana. Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 is also revised down and forecast to grow by 0.67 mb/d (including processing gains) to average 63.33 mb/d. Supply from the US and Other Asia is revised down, whereas supply from Canada is upwardly revised. US supply is revised 0.21 mb/d lower in 2021, compared to last month’s assessment, to grow by 0.16 mb/d and average of 17.77 mb/d. While higher oil prices remain a stimulating factor, supply from the US is challenged by short-term uncertainties around COVID-19, continued capital expenditure discipline leading to lower upstream capital spending by US oil companies. The supply forecast for Canada in 2021 is adjusted higher by 45 tb/d, to an average of 5.44 mb/d. Measures taken by the new US Administration to ban new oil and gas drilling on federal lands and cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline permit are not expected to have a significant impact on the US and Canada shortterm supply forecast. The key drivers for non-OPEC supply growth are forecast to be Canada, Brazil, the US, Norway, Ecuador, Qatar and Guyana, while oil production, mainly in Russia, the Sudans, Malaysia and the UK is forecast to decline. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2020 is estimated to decline by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.13 mb/d. For 2021, it is forecast to grow by 0.08 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.21 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in January was up by 0.18 mb/d m-o-m to average 25.50 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids output in January, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have increased by 0.25 mb/d m-o-m to average 67.62 mb/d, lower by 4.47 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply rose in January by 0.43 mb/d m-o-m to average 93.12 mb/d, down by 7.33 mb/d y-o-y.

Canadian oil production began to mb/d rise in September, mainly due to maintenance ending. 2.2 Canadian oil output has rebounded strongly and is 2.0 1.98 returning to pre-COVID levels as a result of higher 1.8 prices and the lifting of Alberta's curtailment order to 1.6 1.4 1.26 producers. 1.2 1.19 Alberta’s government announced on 23 October 2020 1.0 1.14 that it would lift production curtailments, which had 0.8 Dec 19 Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 been introduced in 2018, starting from January 2021.

The US President moved to cancel permits for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office. The world's largest market for heavy, sour crude is the US Gulf Coast, which has very limited pipeline access from Western Canada. The Keystone XL pipeline had been projected to carry oil nearly 1,900 km from Alberta to Nebraska, where it would join an existing pipeline to transfer the Canadian heavy crude to the Gulf Coast. If it had been commissioned on time in late 2023, the pipeline would have provided Canadian oil sands producers with 830 tb/d of incremental export capacity to US markets. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. The Biden administration’s decision comes as unwelcome news for Canada, which has a single large buyer of its heavy crude and the decision reduces Alberta’s ability to compete for high prices. “However, the impact on Western Canadian oil production in the nearto mid-term is likely to be muted,” according to Rystad Energy. “Most Canadian producers have already factored egress constraints, not to mention uncertainty over demand, into their near-term growth profiles”, Rystad Energy added. Canada’s oil supply estimate for 2020 has been revised up by 15 tb/d, following upward adjustments to 4Q20 of 61 tb/d. It is now estimated to contract by 0.24 mb/d y-o-y for an average of 5.17 mb/d. For 2021, the supply forecast was also revised up by 45 tb/d. It is now expected to see growth of 0.27 mb/d y-o-y to average 5.44 mb/d.

Non-OECD Non-OECD liquids production for 2020 was revised down by 35 tb/d m-o-m to show an estimated decline of 1.48 mb/d y-o-y and average 31.45 mb/d, mainly due to downward revisions in Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia and Egypt. China’s liquids supply is estimated to have grown by 0.09 mb/d y-o-y to average 4.15 mb/d. The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and the consequent lower demand continued to dampen India’s crude oil production in 2020, with output estimated to have dropped by 0.06 mb/d y-o-y to average 0.77 mb/d.

Unlike the strong capex increases seen in the past two years, lower spending on oil sector E&P – compared to higher capex allocated to boosting natural gas production – is expected to lead to oil production remaining broadly flat next year to average 4.16 mb/d. This compares to the remarkable growth of 0.09 mb/d y-o-y in 2020, to average 4.15 mb/d. Latin America Latin America’s total liquids supply in December rose by 0.01 mb/d m-o-m, to average 5.88 mb/d, down by 0.57 mb/d y-o-y. Liquids production in 2020 is estimated to have expanded in Brazil by 0.12 mb/d, to average 3.68 mb/d, and in Guyana by 0.07 mb/d, to average 0.07 mb/d. By contrast, oil production in other countries in the region is estimated to have declined. Latin America’s oil supply in 4Q20 fell by 0.23 mb/d q-o-q to average 5.91 mb/d. The region’s oil supply for 2020 is now estimated to have dropped by 0.02 mb/d y-o-y, to average 6.06 mb/d. This is mainly due to lower-than-expected oil output in Brazil in 4Q20 due to prolonged maintenance. The shut-in of wells on the back of COVID-19 and a slowdown in drilling and operations caused lower production in the region. Rystad Energy estimates that around 3.2 billion barrels of resources were discovered in the region in 2020, of which 80% was found in the Guyana-Suriname Basin alone. It also reported that “globally only 12 major projects (with reserves greater than 100 million boe) were sanctioned in the past year, down from 46 projects sanctioned in 2019. South America dominated sanctioning activity with four major projects entering development stage in Guyana and Brazil.” For 2021, oil production is projected to grow by 0.29 mb/d y-o-y, to average 6.35 mb/d. Oil production in Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana and Peru is forecast to increase, owing to production ramp-ups in fields that started in 2019 and 2020. Production in Ecuador is projected to recover by 0.06 mb/d from outages in 2020, to average 0.55 mb/d. Oil production is likely to remain flat in other countries of the region. Brazil Brazil’s crude oil production in December was down by 0.04 mb/d m-o-m to average 2.72 mb/d, a drop of 0.39 mb/d y-o-y, mainly due to planned field maintenance in the Tupi and Buzios oil fields. Crude output hit 3.09 mb/d in August 2020, but began to decline in September and subsequent months and continued into December. This was not only because of maintenance, but also due to COVID-19-related safety measures leading to the postponement of scheduled work from 4Q20 to the beginning of 2021, according to Petrobras. NGLs production increased m-o-m in December by 15 tb/d and returned to the August level of 104 tb/d. In December, Brazil liquids production, including biofuels, was lower by 0.02 mb/d, to average 3.46 mb/d. 44 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 World Oil Supply Graph 5 22: Brazil’s crude oil and liquids output Graph 5 23: Brazil’s quarterly and annual liquids output mb/d mb/d 4.0 4.2 Avg. 21 3.98 3.6 4.0 Avg. 20 3.85 3.8 Avg. 19 3.68 3.2 3.46 3.56 3.6 2.8 2.72 3.4 2.4 3.2 Dec 19 Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 3.0 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q* 2Q* 3Q* 4Q* Crude oil output Liquids supply 2019 2020 2021 Sources: ANP, Petrobras and OPEC.

For 2021, liquids supply is forecast to grow by 0.17 mb/d to average 3.85 mb/d, mainly due to crude oil production from pre-salt areas. Incremental production is anticipated to come from several project ramp-ups such as the Berbigao/Sururu and Atapu fields, each having a peak capacity of 150 tb/d, which started in 4Q19 and 2Q20, respectively. In addition, Petrobras will start to produce oil from two large projects – Sepia and Mero I – each having 180 tb/d peak capacity, and both scheduled to start in 2H21. The Mero offshore field is said to be Brazil’s third largest pre-salt discovery and has been undergoing test production since 2017.

In the USGC, the positive impact of the recent holiday season sustained transport fuel markets despite strong refinery runs and rising product inventories over the month. In Europe, refining economics reversed trend, but saw limited gains relative to other regions given the subdued product drawdowns, seasonal weakness and strict COVID-19 related lockdown measures. In Asia, robust performance in light-end markets filtered through to gasoline markets too. This offset the poor performance registered across the midand bottom section of the barrel. Refinery margins US refinery margins extended their upward trend for Graph 6 1: Refining margins the fifth consecutive month. Margins also exhibited US$/b US$/b the largest upturn relative to other regions. 15 15 Part of this development is attributed to the positive 10 10 effect for product markets from the holiday season. However, rising product inventory levels, stronger 5 5 refinery runs and continued lockdown measures as concerns over COVID-19 variants mount, point to 0 0 pressure on US refining economics in the near term. -5 -5 US refinery margins for WTI averaged $9.42/b in January, up by $1.31/b m-o-m, but down by $3.05 Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 y-o-y. WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) Oman (Singapore) Sources: Argus and OPEC. Refinery margins in Europe recovered some ground following losses witnessed the previous month. There was positive performance across the entire barrel, with the exception of gasoil. Gasoline exports to West Africa provided downward pressure on inventory levels for the same product, which ultimately led to solid gasoline crack spread gains. The ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in January, as well a hike in sour crude prices, particularly those most preferred by European refiners, continued to weigh on product markets. However, the start of Europe’s vaccination campaign against COVID-19 in January, with nearly one million doses administered daily, has helped provide a more optimistic landscape for transport fuels going forward. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $1.26/b in January, up 74 ¢ compared with a month earlier, but down by $3.70 y-o-y. Asian product markets strengthened slightly, with strong petrochemical margins amid returning steam cracker capacity providing support to naphtha and subsequently to gasoline markets. Improvements in refinery throughput in Asia, albeit at a slower-than-expected rate, shadowed the decline of new COVID-19 infections in early January. However, towards mid-January, the introduction of renewed mobility restrictions in Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia have most likely capped demand-related support and limited further improvements in refining margins. Recent concerns over a possible resurgence of the virus in China pointed to further downside on domestic fuel consumption levels. This may ultimately weigh on fuel prices going forward as local authorities discouraged travel over the Lunar New Year period. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia gained 76<U+023C> m-o-m to average $1.60/b in January, which was higher by $2.48 y-o-y.

They reached a Graph 6 3: US Gulf crack spread vs. WTI ten-month high supported by holiday travel on the US$/b US$/b road, as well as exports to Mexico. In addition, the rise 20 20 in gasoline prices was supported by stronger crude oil prices. 10 10 US peak traffic hours during the holiday season reached a pandemic high, with a congestion index 0 0 posting the largest m-o-m rise since July. However, the level remained below 2019 levels in all cities, -10 -10 according to secondary sources. Notwithstanding the holiday season, lockdowns Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 continued to weigh on gasoline consumption in Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene January when compared to levels seen a year ago, Diesel Fuel oil amid sinking demand.

US gasoline crack spreads gained $2.91 m-o-m to average $14.14 in January, albeit down by $1.70/b y-o-y. USGC jet/kerosene weakened as the upward trend registered over the previous three months took a downturn in January. Considerable stock builds in line with reports of declines in passenger air travel activity during the month contributed to the downturn in jet fuel markets. Moreover, prevailing international travel restrictions, strict quarantine regulations in many countries, and changing customer habits towards air travel, such as preference for non-stop flights instead of connecting routes, continue to weigh on jet fuel markets. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $7.83/b, down by $1.17 m-o-m and by $9.17 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI lost some ground, pressured by ample product availability and despite an open arbitrage window to Europe. The weak gasoil volume requirements from Europe failed to provide a much needed outlet. Another negative factor was the rise in US output levels in response to stronger refinery intakes that contributed to a decline in gasoil margins. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $6.07/b, down by $1.07 m-o-m and by $7.11 y-o-y. 50 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI extended their downward trend, with fuel oil prices reaching an 11month high as the product’s balance tightened further during the month. In January, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $2.48/b, down by $1.19 m-o-m, albeit up by $1.72 y-o-y. European market Gasoline crack spreads rebounded following a three Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent month downward trend. This was despite weak US$/b US$/b domestic consumption signals and ample product 20 20 availability that was exacerbated by the reimplementation of stricter restriction measures over 10 10 the month in response to a surge in the numbers of new variant COVID-19 cases. This, weighed heavily 0 0 on mobility activities and gasoline consumption. In January, firm gasoline exports to West Africa were -10 -10 the main supporting factor behind the positive gasoline market performance, although overall Jan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 fundamentals remained mostly unsupportive.

Jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent rose slightly over the month, with jet fuel demand from the aviation sector supportive around the holiday season which led to a tighter balance. However, the multi-month upward trend in the jet fuel crack spread almost stalled in January, indicative of a less supportive outlook in the near term. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $4.67/b, up 16 ¢ m-o-m, but down by $8.88 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads moved downwards in January, albeit to a limited extent, pressured by stronger gasoil availability in line with a rise in monthly refinery runs. Moreover, the winter-related support from heating fuels was rather moderate and the region’s low temperatures were not sustained long enough to provide any significant backing. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $5.33/b, which was lower by 13 ¢ m-o-m and by $7.56 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% cracks spreads reversed trend, partially recovering some of the losses witnessed in the previous month. Prevailing market tightness in other regions, as well as existing requirements, albeit limited, for heating and utilities in Asia provided support, despite stronger production rates within the region. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $5.88/b in January, having gained 21 ¢ m-o-m, and $19.11 y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92 crack spread gained some ground in response to strengthening naphtha crack spreads, which helped keep gasoline prices sustained. In addition, expectations of tighter Asian gasoline supplies and possibly higher prices in north Asia, particularly leading up to spring maintenance and in 2Q21, may have incentivised regional stock builds. The Philippines, Australia and Malaysia were reported to have imported more gasoline as some of their domestic refineries were due to shut, and additionally, Indonesia’s consumption figures have improved since late last year. The Singapore gasoline crack spread against Oman in January averaged minus $4.16/b, up by $1.54 ¢ m-om, but down by 82 ¢ y-o-y.

Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene Gasoil Fuel oil Sources: Argus and OPEC. In the middle of the barrel, jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia reversed trend and weakened, following three consecutive months of recorded gains. The tighter pandemic-related lockdown measures likely played a role in the poor jet fuel performance with a reported 35-40% cancellation of domestic flights during the month in Japan alone. On the other hand, kerosene markets continued to benefit from the severe winter, although the cold front in Northeast Asia has started to ease, which suggests further pressure in the near term. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $3.26/b, down by 83 ¢ m-o-m and by $7.98 yo-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread ended a four-month upward trend and took a slight downturn, although it retained some of the gains recorded in the previous month. Stronger gasoil supplies from India, as well as preliminary indications of rising gasoil exports, may have led to a lengthening balance for the same product within the region that likely weighed on their crack spreads. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $4.11/b, down by 61 ¢/b m-o-m and by $8.09 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spreads, suffered further losses and reached a six month low, pressured by prevailing LNG competition as an alternative feedstock for the utilities sector, as LNG prices, remained relatively lower. In addition, stronger HSFO yields practiced by Japanese refiners may have contributed to the poor performance witnessed during the month. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $4.41/b, down by 71 ¢ m-o-m, but up by $10.28 y-o-y. 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Table 6 1: Short-term prospects for product markets and refinery operations Time Event Asia Europe US Observations frame Winter season Jan 21 <U+F0EA> Negative <U+F0EA> Negative <U+F0EA> Negative Seasonality as well as hard impact on impact on impact on lockdowns due to concern over the product product product spread of a new variant of markets markets markets COVID-19 could pressure fuel markets in the immediate near term.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 55 Tanker Market Tanker Market Dirty tanker rates remained at muted levels in January, below operational costs in some cases, although rates from West Africa picked up. A host of factors have weighed on freight rates, including the lingering impact of COVID-19 on oil consumption, reduced supplies in the market, ample onshore inventories, and long tonnage lists. The backwardated market structure also provided little incentive to hold inventory in floating storage, even at the current low rates. Meanwhile, clean tanker rates improved, supported by activities West of Suez, but are still caught up in the general malaise. From the current vantage point, the outlook for freight rates remains lacklustre, certainly in 1H21, but potentially also into 2022. Spot fixtures Global spot fixtures declined m-o-m in January, falling by 2.6 mb/d, or 15.7%, to average 13.8 mb/d. Fixtures fell back from the high levels seen in the final quarter of the year. Spot fixtures were 4.4 mb/d, or around 24%, lower than the same month last year, prior to the COVID-19 impacts.

OPEC spot fixtures experienced a m-o-m decline of 0.8 mb/d, or 8%, in January to average 9.5 mb/d. The lower fixtures came ahead of planned and announced adjustments. Compared with the same month last year, OPEC spot fixtures were almost 25% lower, or down by around to 3.1 mb/d. Fixtures from the Middle East-to-East averaged 5.7 mb/d in January, representing a decline of just 0.2 mb/d, or around 3%, m-o-m. Y-o-y, this represents a fall of 2.0 mb/d, or almost 26%. In contrast, Middle East-to-West fixtures recovered some ground lost the previous month, increasing by 9%, or just under 0.1 mb/d m-o-m, to average 0.8 mb/d. This was still 0.3 mb/d, or 26%, lower compared with the same month last year. Outside of the Middle East, fixtures fell sharply in percentage terms, down by 0.7 mb/d, or 20%, m-o-m to average 2.9 mb/d. Y-o-y, fixtures were 0.8 mb/d, or 22%, lower. Sailings and arrivals OPEC sailings averaged 21.6 mb/d in January, representing a 1.0 mb/d, or over 4%, decline m-o-m. Y-o-y, OPEC sailings were almost 3.0 mb/d, or 12%, lower. Middle East sailings averaged 16.2 mb/d, representing a m-o-m increase of 0.1 mb/d, or less than 1%, but were down 1.7 mb/d, or close to 10%, compared with the same month last year. Crude arrivals in January rose on all routes with the exception of West Asia, reversing the previous month’s trend. Far East arrivals led gains, increasing by 1.1 mb/d, or over 10%, to average 11.9 mb/d. Arrivals on the route were also 3.2 mb/d, or 37%, higher compared with January 2019. Arrivals in Europe increased by 0.8 mb/d, or almost 8%, to average 10.8 mb/d. Y-o-y, arrivals on the route were almost 1.2 mb/d, or 10%, lower. North American arrivals increased by 0.5 mb/d, or 6%, but still registered a decline of 1.1 mb/d, or 12%, compared with the same month last year. Arrivals in West Asia relinquished all of the previous month’s gains, dropping by 0.8 mb/d, or nearly 13%, to average 5.3 mb/d. Compared to the same month in the previous year, West African arrivals declined 1.2 mb/d or almost 30%. 56 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 Tanker Market Table 7 2: Tanker sailings and arrivals, mb/d Change Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Jan 21/Dec 20 Sailings OPEC 20.33 22.63 21.63 -1.00 Middle East 14.35 16.14 16.24 0.10 Arrivals North America 7.63 7.44 7.91 0.47 Europe 10.31 10.02 10.78 0.76 Far East 11.09 10.81 11.92 1.11 West Asia 5.38 6.08 5.32 -0.76 Sources: Oil Movements and OPEC. Dirty tanker freight rates Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) VLCC spot rates continued to move higher from the very low levels seen since last summer, edging up 5% m-o-m, although remaining 60% lower compared with the same month of the previous year. Rates on the Middle East-to-East route were negligibly higher m-o-m, up 1% in January to average WS35 points. Y-o-y, rates were 62% lower compared with the same month last year. Rates on the Middle East-to-West route increased by 3% m-o-m to average WS24 points. Y-o-y, rates declined 55%. The West Africa-to-East route also saw a marginal increase to average WS36 points. Rates were 60% lower compared with January 2019.

Gains were seen on the CrossMed and Med-to-NWE routes, which rose 32% and 35%, respectively, to average WS121 and WS138 points. Meanwhile, rates on the NWE-to-USEC route also enjoyed an increase, up 44% m-o-m to average WS110 points. Clean spot rates were still 33% lower compared with the same month last year. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 59 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports averaged 5.9 mb/d in January, the highest since July 2020, following a strong increase in imports from Canada. US crude exports were steady at close to 3.1 mb/d. US product imports were the highest in three months, averaging 2.1 mb/d in January, with bottom of the barrel products providing support. Product exports were also largely unchanged, averaging 5.2 mb/d. China’s crude imports hit a three-year low in December, averaging 9.1 mb/d. The decline came as independents were largely absent from the market and the backlog of ships waiting offshore cleared. Early indications point to a rebound in crude imports at the start of the year as independents have a fresh round of quotas. The complete data for 2020 shows China set a new record high for crude imports last year, averaging 10.9 mb/d, an increase of 0.7 mb/d over the previous year. This surpasses the US record high of 10.2 mb/d set in 2005. India’s crude imports continued to see healthy m-o-m gains in December, averaging 4.8 mb/d, the first y-o-y gain in eight months and the country’s second-highest on record. In annual terms, India’s crude imports averaged 4.0 mb/d in 2020, a decline of almost 11% y-o-y and representing a four-year low. Product imports saw a sharp 23% m-o-m increase in December, averaging 1.2 mb/d, with gains across all major products except naphtha. In 2020, India’s product imports averaged above 1.0 mb/d for the first time on record. Product exports rose 12% to average 1.2 mb/d in December, with gains led by diesel and naphtha. In annual terms, product exports were 11% lower y-o-y. Japan’s crude imports averaged 2.5 mb/d in 2020, the lowest average since at least 1980. Product imports averaged 0.9 mb/d last year, representing a 3% increase y-o-y. Product exports, however, were the lowest since 2010. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports averaged 5.9 mb/d in January, the highest since July 2020. This represented an increase of 0.4 mb/d m-o-m, but was still 0.5 mb/d lower y-o-y. The gains were driven by a strong increase in inflows from Canada, with further support from Colombia, while Brazil and Mexico registered declines. US crude exports were steady in January, slipping a negligible 0.2%, to average around 3.0 mb/d. As a result, crude departures maintained the gains seen since dipping to a low of 2.7 mb/d in November. A rise in outflows of medium-sour grades from the US Gulf Coast’s LOOP terminal contributed to the good performance for the month. The latest monthly data for US crude exports by destination shows increasing buying by India in November 2020, which increased to 0.4 mb/d from 0.2 mb/d the month before. This partially compensated for lower flows to China, which fell to 0.3 mb/d from 0.7 mb/d in the prior month.

Compared to the same month in the previous year, US product imports were down less than 3%. US product exports averaged 5.2 mb/d in January, representing a m-o-m decline of less than 1%, or 50 tb/d. Compared to the previous year, product exports were 0.7 mb/d, or 12%, lower than the same month of the previous year. As a result, US net product exports averaged 3.1 mb/d in January, compared with 3.3 mb/d the month before and 3.8 mb/d in January 2020. Preliminary data indicates that the US was a net crude and product exporter in January, with net outflows of 0.2 mb/d, compared with net outflows of 0.8 mb/d the month before and 0.6 mb/d in January 2020.

Sources: EIA and OPEC. China China’s crude imports hit a three-year low in December, averaging 9.1 mb/d. The decline came as independents were largely absent from the market and the backlog of ships waiting offshore cleared. Early indications point to crude imports rebounding at the start of the year as independents have a fresh round of quotas to bring in crude. The now full yearly data shows China set a new record high for crude imports in 2020, averaging 10.9 mb/d, an increase of 0.7 mb/d over the previous year. The only other country that has come close to this level of imports is the US, which recorded a record high of 10.2 mb/d in 2005. In monthly terms, China’s crude imports peaked last year at 13 mb/d in May and continued at 12 mb/d in June as Chinese importers brought up a considerable quantity of the excess crude on the market, leading to port congestion that took some time to unwind. In this regard, China provided important support to the market at a time of a destabilizing decline in crude import demand from other major consumers. Saudi Arabia remained the top crude supplier to China in December, with a share of almost 18%, representing 1.6 mb/d in imports. Russia came in second with around 1.5 mb/d, representing a 16% share, followed by Angola. Imports from the US averaged 0.8 mb/d in December, broadly stable with the previous month but up from zero imports in the same month a year ago. These higher levels were in line with a phase 1 of a USChina trade agreement signed in January 2020, which included a pledge by China to purchase $200 billion more US goods and services in 2020 and 2021.

Sources: China, Oil and Gas Petrochemicals and OPEC. Product imports slipped back m-o-m in December, averaging 1.2 mb/d, which represents a 6% decline from the previous month. A dip in LPG imports was partially offset by a slight expansion in jet fuel. Compared to the same month last year, product inflows were a considerable 0.3 mb/d or 20% lower. This is due to the very high OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – February 2021 61 Crude and Refined Products Trade level of product imports in December 2019 in preparation for the Golden Week holiday and prior to the onset of COVID-19 impacts. In contrast, product exports rose m-o-m, increasing around 0.2 mb/d or 12% to average 1.4 mb/d in December. The m-o-m increase was driven mainly by an 88% jump in fuel oil inflows and a lesser increase in gasoline, while diesel declined 25%. As a result, China was a net product exporter in December by 0.2 mb/d. This compares to net imports of just 20 tb/d the month before and net exports of 0.2 mb/d in December 2019. In annual terms, China’s product imports averaged 1.3 mb/d in 2020, a decline of 5% compared to the previous year. Product inflows to China have declined since reaching a peak of 1.4 mb/d in 2018, as the country has expanded domestic refinery capacity. COVID-19 impacts certainly contributed to a further decline in 2020. On the exports side, product outflows averaged 1.3 mb/d in 2020, representing a decline of 0.1 mb/d or 9% from the previous year when product exports reached a record high of close to 1.5 mb/d. The decline was mainly due to COVID-19 impacts, which strongly affected demand for jet fuel exports, which was partially offset by an increase in fuel oil outflows. In net terms, China’s product trade was broadly balanced in 2020, with net product exports at 6 tb/d, compared to net exports of 71 tb/d in the previous year.

Japan Japan’s crude imports averaged 2.6 mb/d in December, the highest in seven months. For the year 2020, crude imports averaged 2.5 mb/d, the lowest since at least 1980. Product imports declined 4% m-o-m to average just under 1.0 mb/d in December, with naphtha and LPG leading losses. In 2020, product imports averaged 0.9 mb/d, representing a 3% increase y-o-y. The gains came as refiners opted to import needed petroleum products rather than process crude and have to manage high inventories of jet and diesel. Product exports strengthened 0.1 mb/d or 45% m-o-m to average around 0.5 mb/d in December. Product inflows were still 0.3 mb/d or 36% lower than the same month in 2019. Gains were seen across all major products. For the year, product exports averaged 0.4 mb/d, the lowest since 2010, dragged down by jet fuel and gasoil.
