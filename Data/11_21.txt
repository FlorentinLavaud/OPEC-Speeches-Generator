Strong oil market fundamentals, compounded by expectations of higher oil demand in the winter months from “gas to oil switching”, have supported both spot and futures prices. The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) increased $8.23 or 11.1%, m-o-m, in October to average $82.11/b. Year-to-date, the ORB averaged $68.33/b, for a gain of $27.77, or 68.4%, compared to the same period last year. In the futures market, the ICE Brent front-month contract rose $8.87 or 11.8%, m-o-m, to average $83.75/b in October, while NYMEX WTI increased $9.68 or 13.5%, m-o-m, to average $81.22/b. Consequently, the Brent/WTI spread narrowed by 81¢ to stand at $2.53/b in October. The market structure of all three major oil benchmarks – Brent, WTI and Dubai – strengthened, moving deeper into backwardation on further declines in OECD commercial oil stocks in September and the prospect of stronger near-term market fundamentals. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted bullish positions related to NYMEX WTI in October as data showed ongoing drawdowns in inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub. However, speculators cut bullish positions related to ICE Brent. World Economy Global economic growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 remain unchanged from the last month’s assessment at 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively. For the US, lower-than-expected economic growth in 3Q21 has resulted in a downward revision for 2021. The US economy is now expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 and by 4.1% in 2022. Euro-zone economic growth for 2021 is revised up slightly to 5.1%, after continued strong growth in 3Q21, and remains at 3.9% for 2022. Japan’s economic growth forecast for 2021 is revised down slightly to 2.5%, due to ongoing COVID-19-related social-distancing measures in 3Q21, while the forecast for 2022 remains at 2%. After a strong recovery in the first half of the year, China’s economic growth forecast remains at 8.3% in 2021 and 5.8% in 2022. Similarly, India’s economic growth forecast for 2021 is also unchanged at 9% for 2021 and 6.8% for 2022. Russia remains at 4% for 2021 at 2.7% for 2022. Brazil’s economic growth forecast is also unchanged for 2021, but was revised down slightly to 2% for 2022. The ongoing robust growth in the world economy continues to be challenged by uncertainties related to the spread of COVID-19 variants and the pace of vaccine rollouts worldwide, as well as ongoing global supplychain bottlenecks. Additionally, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with rising inflationary pressures and potential central bank responses, remain key factors requiring close monitoring. World Oil Demand World oil demand growth in 2021 is revised lower by around 0.16 mb/d, compared to last month’s assessment, to stand at 5.7 mb/d. Revisions were mainly to account for slower than anticipated demand from China and India in 3Q21. Global oil demand is now estimated to reach 96.4 mb/d in 2021. For 2022, growth in global oil demand remains unchanged compared to the previous month’s assessment, to stand at 4.2 mb/d. World total demand in 2022 is now estimated to reach 100.6 mb/d, around 0.5 mb/d above 2019 levels. Marginal upward revisions in OECD Europe, due better economic views in some European countries, were offset by softer growth in industrial fuel demand, in OECD America and Latin America. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply is expected to grow by 0.7 mb/d in 2021, unchanged from last month’s assessment, to average 63.6 mb/d. This is despite a marginal upward revision of 0.02 mb/d from the US, Canada, and Mexico, which were offset by a similar downward adjustment in the non-OECD. The main drivers of 2021 supply growth continue to be Canada, Russia, China, Norway, Brazil and Guyana. The forecast for non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2022 is also unchanged at 3.0 mb/d to average 66.7 mb/d. Russia and the US are expected to be the main drivers of next year’s growth, contributing increments of 1.0 mb/d and 0.9 mb/d, respectively, followed by Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, Norway, Guyana and other countries in the DoC. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d both in 2021 and 2022 to average 5.2 mb/d and 5.3 mb/d, respectively. In October, OPEC crude oil production increased by 0.22 mb/d m-o-m, to average 27.45 mb/d, according to available secondary sources. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 iii Oil Market Highlights Product Markets and Refining Operations Product markets in all main trading hubs retained their previous month’s strength in October, as refining economics continued to trend upwards, posting solid gains. Further declines in refinery processing rates attributable to the peak maintenance season weighed on product inventory levels and continued to keep product balances tight. This drove middle distillates to retain their position as the strongest margin contributors in the Atlantic Basin. In Asia, sustained fuel demand, amid limited product exports from China as refiners focused on supplying the domestic market, provided considerable support to Asian fuel markets, particularly at the top and middle sections of the barrel. Tanker Market Dirty tanker spot freight rates gained some positive momentum in October, with increases across all classes. VLCCs and Suezmax enjoyed the highest rates so far this year, with gains averaging 16% and 29%, respectively, m-o-m, while Aframax rates were up 22% m-o-m. For VLCCs, the Middle East-to-East route gained 17% m-o-m. For Suezmax, the West Africa-to-US Gulf Coast increased 35%. In the clean market, spot freight rates strengthened, as a 22% gain West of Suez offset a 6% decline in the East. The tanker market’s performance is likely to improve through the end of the year, as concerns regarding an energy crunch in the power sector over winter support tonnage demand for crude and products, particularly in Asia. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports in October eased from their summer highs to average 6.1 mb/d, while crude exports averaged 2.8 mb/d, supported by a pickup of flows to Europe. The latest data for September shows China’s crude imports fell back, averaging 10.0 mb/d as independent refiners remained on the sidelines, due to a lack of crude import quotas. In India, crude imports hit a five-month high, averaging 4.3 mb/d in September, as refiners boosted runs amid a recovery in economic activity. Japan’s crude imports declined from the previous month’s peak but still remained at a relatively good level of 2.5 mb/d in September as refiners looked toward preparations for winter. In OECD Europe, the latest data for July shows crude imports remaining strong at 8.6 mb/d, while crude exports continued to edge higher reaching 0.4 mb/d, amid a return of flows to Asia. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary September data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks up by 18.5 mb, m-o-m. At 2,805 mb, inventories were 374 mb lower than the same month last year; 206 mb lower than the latest five-year average; and 163 mb lower than the 2015-2019 average. Within the components, crude and products stocks fell by 9.3 mb and 9.2 mb, m-o-m, respectively. At 1,334 mb, OECD crude stocks stood 118 mb below the latest five-year average and 103 mb below the 2015-2019 average. At 1,471 mb, OECD product stocks stood 89 mb below the latest five-year average, and were 60 mb below the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks fell 0.2 days, m-o-m, in September to stand at 61.5 days. This is 12.4 days lower than the same month last year; 2.8 days below the latest five-year average; and 0.7 days lower than the 2015-2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 was revised slightly down by 0.1 mb/d from the previous month to stand at 27.6 mb/d, around 4.9 mb/d higher than in 2020. Demand for OPEC crude in 2022 was also revised slightly down by 0.1 mb/d from the previous month to stand at 28.7 mb/d, around 1.0 mb/d higher than in 2021. iv OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Recent developments of global oil inventories Global oil inventories, which serve as a tangible measure of the oil market balance, are grouped in three major components. The first group is OECD’s commercial oil stocks and Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR). Clearly, the OECD commercial stocks serve as a key indicator of the status of the oil market balance, as they are frequently published by national government reporting systems, and as the seasonal variations in the OECD commercial stock levels are linked to oil demand through an inverse relationship. The second major group is the non-OECD commercial inventories and SPR, which have become more important in recent years as non-OECD oil demand has increased, taking a higher share than the OECD in total world oil demand and requiring more stockpiling. However, inventory levels in the non-OECD are hard to track due to a lack of complete data. In the absence of regularly reported data, stock levels in non-OECD are often estimated using information released by companies and ministries, as well as data published in the JODI database. The final group is oil at sea, which includes “oil afloat” and “oil in transit”. In the 2Q20, the global oil market saw oil supply Graph 1: Global oil inventory stocks heavily outpacing world oil demand, leading to a mb drastic surge in global oil inventories, within a short 10,000 span of a couple of months. In response to this critical 8,000 situation, in April 2020, OPEC and non-OPEC oil 6,000 producing countries participating in the ‘Declaration 4,000 of Cooperation’ (DoC) announced voluntary 2,000 productions adjustments commensurate with the 0 huge oil stock surplus, to achieve the rebalancing and stabilization of the global oil market. Jan 17 May 17 Sep 17 Jan 18 May 18 Sep 18 Jan 19 May 19 Sep 19 Jan 20 May 20 Sep 20 Jan 21 May 21 Sep 21 Oil at sea Since its historic peak in June 2020, global oil Non-OECD (commercial and SPR) inventories have declined significantly. At the end of OECD SPR OECD commercial September 2021 they had fallen by 938 mb, with all Total components witnessing stock draws. Sources: Argus Media, EIA, Euroilstock, IEA, METI and OPEC. Over this period, total OECD commercial and SPR stocks have dropped by 411 mb and 46 mb, respectively, while non-OECD and oil at sea have fallen by 320 mb and 160 mb, respectively (Graph 1). Moreover, OECD commercial oil inventories, Graph 2: OECD commercial oil stocks compared to the latest five-year average (2015mb mb 2019), reached a high of around 270 mb in June 3,300 400 2020, clearly reflecting a huge supply excess. This 3,200 300 surplus has since declined to a deficit of 163 mb at 3,100 200 the end of September 2021, mainly driven by DoC 3,000 100 2,900 0 successful efforts to stabilize the market and 2,800 -100 supported by higher refinery crude runs, which is an 2,700 -200 indicator of an improvement in oil demand on the back of an economic recovery following the initial Jan 17 May 17 Sep 17 Jan 18 May 18 Sep 18 Jan 19 May 19 Sep 19 Jan 20 May 20 Sep 20 Jan 21 May 21 Sep 21 impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Graph 2).

This is equivalent to a total implied stock draw of 342 mb. With these market developments, the countries participating in the DoC continue their course to increase production starting August 2021, to gradually return the adjusted production volumes by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis, until the phasing out of the total 5.8 mb/d adjustment in 2022. The DoC will continue to review the market conditions on a regular basis, reaffirming the participating countries’ commitment to ensure adequate supply and support efforts to maintain global oil market stability.

North Sea Brent averaged above $83/b, while Dubai and WTI first forward month averaged above $81/b. Rising oil futures prices and higher oil demand prospects in the winter months due to gas-to-oil switching, as well as stronger refining margins and the continued decline in oil stocks in major consuming regions, greatly supported spot crude oil prices over the month. The ORB rose by $8.23 in October, or 11.1%, to average $82.11/b. The rise of the ORB value was less compared to other major benchmarks due to lower October official selling prices (OSPs) of medium and heavy sour crudes, specifically for grades delivered to the Asian market. Crude oil futures prices on a daily basis, mainly driven by worries about supply turmoil in Europe’s and Asia’s power sector ahead of the winter season, and soaring energy prices, particularly for gas and coal, to historically high levels in Europe and Asia. The ICE Brent front-month rose by $8.87, or 11.8%, in October to average $83.75/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $9.68, or 13.5%, to average $81.22/b. Y-t-d, ICE Brent was $27.10, or 63.9%, higher at $69.52/b, while NYMEX WTI was higher by $28.32, or 73.8%, at $66.67/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices increased m-o-m in October by $8.82, or 12.1%, to settle at $81.81/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $25.87, or 61.3%, at $68.06/b. Hedge funds and other money managers were bullish on the outlook for oil prices in October, as soaring energy prices in Europe and Asia likely urged speculators to bet on higher oil prices. However, they diverged on their exposures regarding the two major benchmarks of ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI. While speculators raised net long positions related to NYMEX WTI, they cut net long positions in ICE Brent. The backwardation structure of all crude prices steepened in October and the calendar spread between the nearest futures contracts moved into deeper backwardation. This reflected the market perception of stronger market fundamentals in the near-term and lower global crude oil inventory levels. The expectation of higher oil demand during the winter and the forecast for slower oil supply growth in non-OPEC countries, have pushed the near-month contract spreads higher compared to later month contracts. The value of light sweet crude strengthened against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in Asia and the US Gulf Coast (USGC), amid higher margins of light and medium sweet crudes compared to heavier sour crudes. The lower west-to-east flow of light sweet crude contributed to a widening of the spread of sweet/sour crudes. However, in Europe, the Brent-Urals spread widened on a strengthening Urals value on the back of firm demand from European refiners and an easing supply overhang for the grade. Crude spot prices Major spot crude oil benchmarks surged by more Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement than 12% in October. North Sea Brent averaged US$/b above $83/b, while Dubai and WTI first forward month 90 averaged above $81/b. 80 Rising oil futures prices and prospects of higher oil 70 demand in the winter months due to gas-to-oil 60 switching, as well as stronger refining margins and the 50 continued decline in oil stocks in major consuming regions, greatly supported spot crude oil prices over 40 the month. Oil prices continued to increase over 30 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 October given ongoing positive market sentiment on the back of improving market fundamentals and signs of a resumption in crude oil demand from refiners that should raise their runs to benefit from healthier OPEC Basket North Sea Dated WTI refining margins. Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements Spot prices, specifically in Asia, were also supported by the release of the fourth crude imports quota from the Chinese government. This should raise buying from Chinese independent refiners, although the fourth quota was lower than the previous one. In October, WTI's first-month price rose the most among the other main spot benchmarks, increasing by $9.90, or 13.9%, to an average of $81.36/b. North Sea Dated and Dubai's first month rose both respectively by 12.3%, or $9.14 and $8.89, to settle at $83.54/b and $81.46/b. Refinery operations in several major consuming countries remained low in September, mainly due to maintenance, but throughputs are expected to rise in the coming months. In Europe, the refinery intakes of the Europe-16 nations fell m-o-m by 118 tb/d in September, a decline of 1.3% from August, according to Euroilstock data. In the US, according to the EIA weekly data, US refiner net input of crude oil was about 830 tb/d lower, or 5.2% in September. It fell by a further 193 tb/d, or 1.3%, in the four weeks of October, compared to September. Furthermore, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, the country’s refinery throughputs in September fell by 2.6% m-o-m to 56.07 million tons. Crude differentials strengthened in the Atlantic Basin and east Suez markets. This was on the back of healthier demand and buying interests from refiners for November loading barrels, amid higher refining margins for light and middle distillates products, rising oil demand, low oil product stocks in the OECD region, and easing mobility restrictions. This in spite of the projected higher crude production from OPEC and non-OPEC DoC participating countries, in line with the decided production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism.

In the Atlantic Basin, the value of light sweet crudes rose in October and most of the grade values were priced at a premium to North Sea Dated, supported by strong gasoline, gasoil, naphtha, and LPG margins. Furthermore, amid rising gas and hydrogen prices, some refineries raised the share of sweeter crude in their blend to reduce the desulphurization costs. However, the gains in crude differential prices in the Atlantic Basin 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements were limited due to the sharp rise of the front-month for Brent-Dubai Exchange of Futures for Swaps (EFS), which increased above $5/b. This made moving crude to the east unfavourable. North Sea crude differentials mostly rose in October benefiting from firm demand from European refiners, healthier refining margins, and higher prices of similar quality WTI crude from the USGC, as the Brent-WTI spread narrowed. The Forties crude differential rose again on a monthly average in October by 22¢, to settle at a premium of 20¢/b against the Brent benchmark. This compared to a discount of 2¢/b in September. The value of the Ekofisk crude differential also rose by 36¢, to average a premium of 70¢/b in October. Crude differentials of light and medium sweet crude rose in the Mediterranean and West African markets in October, on good buying interest from European buyers, strong refining margins, supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria. However, soft demand from Asian refiners for Atlantic Basin crude amid unfavourable west-to-east arbitrage capped the rise. Crude differentials of Bonny Light, Forcados, and Qua Iboe rose firmly on a monthly average in October by 70¢, $1.06, and 75¢, respectively, to stand at premiums of 10¢/b, 27¢/b, and 4¢/b. In the Mediterranean, Saharan Blend crude differentials were on average 57¢ higher m-o-m in October, to stand at a 25¢/b premium to Brent benchmark. The Caspian CPC Blend differential rose by 65¢ to a discount of $1.01/b on average. In the USGC, increased WTI futures prices in October, compared to other major benchmarks, which makes WTI-related crude more expensive to similar European and Asian crudes, weighed heavily on crude differentials. Lower demand from refiners in the USGC, amid lower runs in September and October, added downward pressure. Sour crude differentials in the USGC, specifically the Mars sour crude, came under further pressure from the potential higher availability of sour crude from US SPR release in 4Q21, and higher inflows from other regions, including from European Urals and the Middle East. Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars crude differentials declined in October, falling on a monthly average by 51¢ and $1.95, respectively, to a premium of 86¢/b and a discount of $2.62/b. The further recovery in buying interest from Asian refiners for the November trading cycle kept the Middle East spot price supported. The value of the Oman crude differential rose m-o-m by 71¢ in October to a premium of $2.30/b. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB climbed by $8.23, or 11.1%, in October to average at $82.11/b. The ORB rose for the second consecutive month on higher related benchmark crude prices amid further improving oil market fundamentals. However, the rise of the ORB was less compared to major benchmarks due to the cut in October OSPs of medium and heavy sour crudes, specifically for grades delivered to the Asian market. Y-t-d, the ORB value was $27.77, or 68.4%, higher at $68.33/b, compared to $40.57/b for the same month in 2020. All ORB component values strengthened in October, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend, and Zafiro – rising m-o-m by $9.35, or 12.8% on average, to $82.26/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy, and Kuwait Export – increased m-o-m by $7.84, or 10.5% on average, to settle at $82.28/b. Murban crude rose m-o-m by $9.32, or 12.7% on average, to settle at $82.73/b. The Merey component rose m-o-m by $7.76, or 14.1% on average, to settle at 62.72/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices rallied in October, mainly driven by worries about the supply turmoil in the Europe’s and Asia’s power sector ahead of the winter season, and soaring energy prices, particularly for gas and coal, to historically high levels in Europe and Asia. Investors’ sentiment turned bullish on higher oil demand growth in the winter months from gas to oil switching, particularly in power generation and the refining and petrochemical sectors. Industry sources estimated that surging natural gas prices could boost oil demand by 0.5 mb/d on average from September 2021 through 1Q22. This came amid strong global oil supply and demand fundamentals and continued oil market rebalancing, while OECD commercial oil stocks fell further in September to below the 2016–2020 average level. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements The NYMEX WTI first month contract jumped m-o-m by almost 14% on average. This increase was the most of all the major futures crude benchmarks, supported by signs of an acceleration in the tightening of the US oil market, especially at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub. US gasoline stocks also fell sharply in October, partly due to low refinery throughputs, adding to signs of a tightening in the oil products market. Meanwhile, ICE Brent and DME Oman's first month increased both m-o-m by about 12% on average. However, oil prices were capped by concerns about global economic growth with the IMF revising lower its forecast, while data showed US industrial output falling the most in seven months in September. The strengthening US dollar value against a basket of other major currencies in October also contributed to limiting the oil price rise. Furthermore, official data showed lower China crude oil imports in September, and US crude oil stocks rose in October from September’s low levels, specifically in the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts 3 (PADD 3). Between the week to 17 September and the week to 29 October, US crude oil stocks rose 20 mb, according to the EIA weekly data. The resurgence of lockdowns in Eastern Europe and Russia due to rising COVID-19 cases, as well as soaring cases in the UK in October to their highest level since July 2021 raised further concerns about near-term oil demand and weighed on oil prices. Table 1 2: Crude oil futures, US$/b Change Year-to-date Crude oil futures Sep 21 Oct 21 Oct/Sep % 2020 2021 NYMEX WTI 71.54 81.22 9.68 13.5 38.35 66.67 ICE Brent 74.88 83.75 8.87 11.8 42.42 69.52 DME Oman 72.99 81.81 8.82 12.1 42.19 68.06 Spread ICE Brent-NYMEX WTI 3.34 2.53 -0.81 -24.3 4.07 2.85 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: CME, DME, ICE and OPEC. The ICE Brent front-month rose by $8.87, or 11.8%, in October to average $83.75/b, and NYMEX WTI increased by $9.68, or 13.5%, to average $81.22/b. Y-t-d, ICE Brent was $27.10, or 63.9%, higher at $69.52/b, while NYMEX WTI was higher by $28.32, or 73.8%, at $66.67/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices increased m-o-m in October by $8.82, or 12.1%, to settle at $81.81/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $25.87, or 61.3%, at $68.06/b. On 10 November, ICE Brent stood at $82.64/b and NYMEX WTI at $81.34/b. The NYMEX WTI crude front-month discount to the same ICE Brent futures month narrowed in October by 81¢ on a monthly average to stand at $2.53/b, and falling below $2/b on daily basis. This makes US crude for export less attractive for arbitrage compared to other similar crudes into both Europe and Asia. The NYMEX WTI benchmark performed better than ICE Brent in October, as the supply and demand fundamentals and crude stocks levels at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub, showed signs of an acceleration of the tightening of the market. WTI futures came under upward pressure from the sharp decline in crude stocks at Cushing that fell by about 9 mb in October to their lowest level since September 2018, according to the EIA weekly data. The prospect of a slow recovery in US oil supply also added support to NYMEX WTI. Similarly, the North Sea Dated premium to WTI Houston narrowed further in October by 47¢ m-o-m, to average $1.44/b. This was due to stronger crude values in the USGC, despite rising crude oil stocks, low refinery throughputs in PADD 3, and the release of US SPR in 4Q21. Hedge funds and other money managers were bullish on the outlook for oil prices in October, as soaring energy prices, specifically those for gas and coal in Europe and Asia, likely urged speculators to bet on higher oil prices. However, they diverged on their exposures for the two major benchmarks of ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI. While speculators raised futures and options net long positions related to NYMEX WTI by about 14% between the week of 28 September and the week of 26 October, they cut futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent by 21% over the same period. Money managers continued to raise bullish positions in October on the expectation of elevated US oil prices amid a continued decline in Cushing, Oklahoma, crude stocks, and a large drop in US gasoline stocks, while the country's oil supply is expected to expand slowly this year. The ICE Brent futures and options net long positions fell to their lowest since last August, as rising oil prices to multi-year highs prompted speculators to take some profits from long positions in anticipation of downward price corrections as gas prices eased from their earlier historical high levels. 4 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements By the end of the week of 26 October, money managers held net long positions equivalent to about 600 mb in the two main crude oil futures and options contracts, the lowest level since mid-September 2021. Hedge funds were net sellers of about 27 mb between the week ending 28 September and the week of 26 October, a decline of 4%.

Money managers cut their combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent by 69,428 contracts, or 21.1%, to reach 259,526 lots between the week of 28 September and the week of 26 October, according to the ICE Exchange. During the same period, gross long positions fell by 51,301 lots, or 13.1%, to 339,794 contracts, while gross short positions rose by 18,127 lots, or 29.2%, to 80,268 contracts during the same period. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long positions related to NYMEX WTI in October, increasing by 42,802 lots, or 14.4%, to stand at 340,844 lots in the week of 26 October. This is due to a drop in short positions by 23,103 lots, or 42.7%, to 31,063 contracts, and an increase of 19,699 lots, or 5.6%, in long positions to 371,907 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract fell in October, dropping from about 6:1 in late September to about 4:1 in the week of 26 October. However, the NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio rose to about 12:1 in the week to 26 October, compared to 7:1 in late September. Total futures and options open interest volumes on the two exchanges declined in October, falling by 1.9%, or 112,670 contracts, to stand at 5.9 million contracts in the week ending 26 October. The futures market structure The backwardation structure of all crude prices steepened in October and the calendar spread between the nearest futures contracts moved into deeper backwardation. This reflected the market perception of stronger market fundamentals in the near-term and lower global crude oil inventory levels. The prospect of higher oil demand during the winter season due to gas to oil switching, amid soaring gas prices in the main trading hubs, and the forecast of slower non-OPEC oil supply growth, have pushed the near-month contract spreads higher compared to later month contracts. Global benchmark Brent's forward curve steepened again in October and the ICE Brent M1-M6 backwardation widened to its highest since September 2019 amid the prospect of accelerating winter demand recovery, signs of tightening oil products supply in several major consuming countries, and the continuing decline in commercial OECD oil stocks. This is despite the upward crude oil supply adjustment by OPEC and non-OPEC producers in the DoC, by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis in both November and December 2021. Healthy oil demand in Europe, an easing supply overhang in the Atlantic Basin, and a forecast of stronger supply/demand balance in 4Q21 contributed to a steepening in the Brent forward curve. The ICE Brent M1-M3 spread widened on average in October by 21¢, from a backwardation of $1.39/b in September, to a backwardation of $1.60/b in October. The ICE Brent’s M1-M6 backwardation also widened in October to settle at $3.94 on average, compared to a backwardation of $3.10/b the previous month. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements DME Oman and Dubai backwardation structures strengthened further last month, signaling robust crude demand for spot cargoes, particularly from Asia-Pacific refiners, as a tighter arbitrage from west-to-east amid rising Brent and WTI values compared to Dubai in October, made Dubai-related crude more attractive for refiners. The release of the fourth crude oil import quotas for Chinese independent refiners in mid-October boosted sentiment for higher crude demand from the Middle East and supported higher oil prices. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 backwardation widened m-o-m by 29¢ in October, to $1.75/b on average, from a backwardation of $1.47/b in September.

Sources: CME and OPEC. Sources: DME and OPEC. In the US, the NYMEX WTI structure also moved into deeper backwardation as crude oil stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub, and the delivery point light sweet crude futures, declined sharply in October to their lowest level since September 2018, amid tight supply/demand fundamentals in the region. Crude oil stocks also fell sharply in PADD 2 to their lowest since September 2018 amid healthy demand from refineries and slow regional supply growth, and total US gasoline stocks dropped to their lowest since November 2017, according to the EIA weekly data. The NYMEX WTI M1-M3 month spread widened slightly by 1¢ to a backwardation of 68¢/b on average in September, compared with a backwardation of 67¢/b in August. Crude spreads The value of light sweet crude in October strengthened against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in Asia and the USGC, amid higher margins of light and medium sweet crudes compared to heavier sour crudes. The rise of naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, and gasoil margins supported the light sweet value higher, while lower fuel oil margins weighed on the value of sour crude. The lower west-to-east flow of light sweet crude contributed to widening the spread of sweet/sour crudes. High prices for natural gas also meant some refiners raised their demand for sweeter crudes, and reduced their hydrocracking and hydro-treating rates. In Europe, however, the Urals values strengthened on firm demand from European refiners and an easing supply overhang of the grade. In Europe, the spread between North Sea Dated and Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC Urals narrowed m-o-m in October by 14¢ to average US$/b $1.61/b. The sour grade value strengthened against 8 the North Sea Dated benchmark on healthy demand 6 from European refiners, and higher flows of the grade 4 to the USGC, which reduced the availability of prompt loading unsold cargoes. The supply disruptions of sour 2 crude in the GoM due to Hurricane Ida, and a 0 narrowing Brent-WTI spread in October to below $2/b -2 opened arbitrage opportunities for Urals to the USGC. On a monthly average, the North Sea Dated-Urals Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 spread narrowed by 14¢ in October to stand at a premium of $1.61/b, compared to a premium of Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals $1.75/b in September. LLS-Mars Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements However, the crude differentials of Urals remained trading at a deep discount to the Brent benchmark, specifically in Northwest Europe, as lower demand from Asia amid unfavourable arbitrage economics and weak fuel oil margins capped the Urals value. In Asia, the value of light sweet Tapis crude to the sour benchmark Dubai continued to rise firmly in October, increasing by $1.15 on average to settle at a premium of $4.86/b, compared to a premium of $3.71/b in September. The value of light sweet crude in the Asia Pacific increased on robust demand from regional refiners and strengthening refining margins of light and medium distillate products like naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel, while weaker fuel oil margins in almost all regions put pressure on sour crude values. Higher crude values of Brent-related crude in the North Sea and West African crudes also made similar grades in the Asia Pacific, like Tapis, more attractive to Asian buyers. Furthermore, the Brent/Dubai EFS widened to its highest since June 2014 on daily basis, and on a monthly average, it widened 62¢ to settle at $4.26/b, which made the domestic Asian grades more attractive to regional refiners compared to crude flows of similar crude from the Atlantic Basin. Similarly, in the USGC, the LLS premium over medium sour Mars widened by $1.42 m-o-m, to an average of $3.48/b in October. The value of Mars sour crude came under pressure from supply disruption of the grade since last September, and the rising availability of sour crude in the USGC amid higher inflows from other regions, including Europe and the Middle East, and the possible release of sour crude from the SPR in 4Q21. Weaker Mars refining margins, along with a decline in fuel oil margins, weighed on the grade value compared to the light sweet grade LLS. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 7 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodities rose across the board for the second consecutive month, with new average price records for natural gas and coal prices in Europe and Asia on concerns of potential shortages should winter temperatures be colder than usual. However, prices receded in the second half of the month on the expectation of higher supplies from Russia in the case of natural gas, and a ramp up in coal production in China, which has alleviated shortages concerns. Crude oil prices rose supported by the expectation of stronger supply/demand fundamentals. Base metals advanced supported by declining inventories, though, towards the end of the month, the expectation of some reductions of the ongoing energy restrictions in China, which would in turn lead to higher output weighed down on prices. Gold prices were relatively stable with little movement in expectations of interest rates during the month. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index rose m-o-m by 16.1% in October, and as it happened the previous month all components rose across all regions. The average index level was up by 79% in the January–October 2021 timeframe, compared with the same period in 2020. The non-energy index rose m-o-m by 3.4%, with the base metals index rising by 4.7% while the agricultural rose by 1.8%. The non-energy index was up by 35.5% in the January–October window, compared to the same period of 2020.

Prices initially strengthened on the expectation of strong winter LNG exports in view record prices in Europe and Asia. However, mild weather and rising production resulted in larger than average injections to storage during the month, which further reduced the deficit vs. the five-year average. According to the Energy Information Administration, utilities added 63 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 29 October 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 3,611 bcf, around 2.7% below the latest five-year average. At the end of September, stocks were 5.1% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe reached another record in October, with the average Title Transfer Facility price up m-o-m by around 36% to average $31.1/mmbtu. Average prices in the January–October period were around four times higher than the same period last year. Prices experienced significant volatility at the beginning of the month, with concern of potential shortages in view of seasonally low inventory levels. Furthermore, soaring LNG prices in Asia, after Chinese official’s directive to ensure adequate supplies for the winter, also supported prices. Prices rose by 40% in a single session 6th of October -, to intraday record highs close to $55/mmbtu, before the Russian officials’ comments suggesting that higher supplies to Europe fully reversed the gains. Prices declined towards the end of the month on the expectation of the above mentioned increase in Russian supplies and lower coal prices as supplies increased in Asia. Inventory levels in Europe showed little increase during the month, and ended October around 77% full – around 16% below the average of the previous five years – vs. 74.7% full at the end of September, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Last year, inventories were close to 95% at the end of October. 8 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Commodity Markets Graph 2 1: Major commodity price indices Graph 2 2: Inventories at the LME Index 1,000 tonnes 1,000 tonnes 300 2,000 140 1,500 100 200 1,000 60 100 Base year 2010 = 100 500 20 0 0 Oct 19 Dec 19 Feb 20 Apr 20 Jun 20 Aug 20 Oct 20 Dec 20 Feb 21 Apr 21 Jun 21 Aug 21 Oct 21 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Energy Non-energy Food Base metals Copper Lead HH natural gas Gold Nickel Zinc Sources: World Bank, S&P Goldman Sachs, Pr.

In the January–October timeframe, prices were 130% higher compared to the same period last year. Flooding in China Shanxi province main coal producing onecompounded fears of supply shortages, in view of low coal stockpiles, and lower coal output reading for the month of September, resulted in a sharp spike of more than 50% in the middle of the month. However, directives from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to ensure adequate winter supplies have resulted in higher production up by around 10% and rising inventories at power plants up by around 50% to 117 million tonnes at the beginning of November when compared to inventory levels the end of September according a recent NDRC statement. This has released the pressure from coal prices, which had given back earlier gains towards the end of October, and as of the date of this report trade around August levels. China’s thermal power output rose by 5.7% y-o-y in September, compared to an increase of 0.3% y-o-y in August the rationing measures. At the same time, coal output decreased by 0.9% y-o-y, versus a slight increase by 0.8% y-o-y in August. Hydropower fell by 0.3% y-o-y in September vs 4.7% y-o-y during August. The base metal price index rose by m-o-m by 4.7% in October, with most components showing monthly average increases supported by declining inventories. Aluminium rose for the ninth consecutive month, up by 3.5% to average $2,934.4/mt. also supported by the ongoing energy power rationing measures in China, which restrict output. However, prices receded towards the end of the month as coal prices receded, suggesting easing of the ongoing energy crunch. Average monthly copper prices rose m-o-m in October by 5.4% to average $9,829.22/mt. Average prices in the January–October period were 56.2% higher than for the same months of 2020. Stock levels at the London Metal Exchange (LME) declined by 36% to 140,175 tonnes at the end of October. Furthermore, a large proportion of the stock schedule that may be scheduled for shipment. Meanwhile, estimations from the International Copper Study Group (ICGS) for the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the January-July period showed a deficit of 95,000 tonnes, versus a market surplus of 58,000 tonnes in the 1H21 estimation the previous month. Iron ore prices dropped by 1.3% m-o-m to $122.9/mt. Average prices in the January–October window were 68.2% higher than the average for the same period last year. As reported in the previous MOMR, steel making in China is restricted due to power rationing measures. Global steel making activity declined by 8.9% y-o-y in September 2021 compared to the same month last year, according to World Steel Association. This was mainly due to a drop in Chinese output of 21.2% y-o-y in September – vs. a drop of 13.2% y-o-y in August. In the group of precious metals, gold prices were stable on average with medium and long term real US interest rates expectations were stable on average during the month. Silver and platinum prices rose by 1.0% and 4.1%, respectively.

With some changes in the forecasts of the various key economies, the global economic growth forecast remains unchanged at 5.6% for 2021 and at 4.2% for 2022. The US GDP growth forecast for 2021 was revised down slightly to 5.5% from 5.8%, reflecting the weakening 3Q21 momentum, while the 2022 growth forecast remained unchanged at 4.1%. Euro-zone 2021 economic growth was revised up to 5.1% from 5% after stronger-than-expected 3Q21 GDP growth. However, considering the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in the Euro-zone, the 2022 GDP growth forecast remains unchanged. The forecast for Japan was revised down somewhat to stand at 2.5%, compared with 2.6% in the previous month, given the softening dynamic in 3Q21. The 2022 GDP growth forecast remains unchanged at 2%. China’s economy is seen to grow at 8.3% in 2021 and 5.8% in 2022, unchanged from the previous month, but mounting challenges in the economy point to a rising downsiderisk. Meanwhile, India’s 2021 growth forecast remains at 9% and at 6.8% for 2022. Brazil’s growth forecast for this year remains at 4.7%, while the 2022 growth forecast was revised down to 2% from 2.5% as the strong rise in inflation and the consequent rise in key interest rates could lead to a slow-down in investments and consumption in the next year. Russia’s GDP growth forecast for 2021 remains at 4% and at 2.7% for 2022. Among the various challenges that the global economic recovery is facing, COVID-19 is expected to remain a dominating factor during the northern-hemisphere winter season. Moreover, the recent issues of supply chain bottlenecks have led to output constraints, albeit at a relatively high global output level. These supply issues in combination with the considerable demand effects after the world-wide lock-downs lifted inflation significantly, adding another concern as inflationary effects may cause rising interest rates in key economies. It remains to be seen whether the supply shocks and the reopening effects that were lifting global demand will quickly be overcome and will turn out to be temporary as is currently expected. The latest inflation numbers in the US and the Euro-zone show no imminent easing of the situation. Producer price developments in Asian economies will also need to be closely monitored. Both India and China, but also Japan, have experienced soaring producer prices, while consumer inflation has remained well anchored. These higher producer price levels could also lead to a lift in consumer prices, only with some delay.

However, growth trends are increasingly diverging and additional uncertainties have emerged. 1H21 showed strong growth at differing levels in most major economies, however 3Q21 growth levels are now seen to have softened in the US, China and other key economies, while the Euro-zone’s growth continued at high levels. However, a rise in COVID-19 cases in OECD Europe and other economies has demonstrated that the pandemic is likely to continue in the northern hemisphere winter season in 4Q21 and beyond. This even seems to have already impacted economies with relatively high vaccination rates as can be seen in the latest consumer spending numbers (i.e. business and consumer sentiment indices of Euro-zone economies). Moreover, it remains to be seen how Asian economies may manage a resurgence in COVID-19 infection rates as, so far, many Asian economies, particularly China, have relied heavily on economically impactful lockdown measures. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 11 World Economy Supply chain issues have become another important matter. There is an ongoing mismatch between order backlogs and the ability to fulfil the current magnitude of orders due to a lack of input goods and inventories. A shortage of semiconductors, among other input goods, has been ongoing, and prices of semiconductor companies have remained elevated in October based on the latest Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index levels. Bottlenecks in logistical capabilities have accentuated this problem, while the situation seems to have improved recently. The Baltic Dry Shipping Price Index has fallen to around 2800 at the beginning of November after peaking at around 5600 at the beginning of October. However, the combination of supply chain shortages and logistical challenges has continuously put pressure on prices over the past months, lifting inflation. In addition, selective labour market shortages have added to the problem, and it remains to be seen if inflation will be a temporary issue. With rising COVID-19 cases, the sectors of travel and tourism, as well as hospitality and leisure may be particularly exposed and that may especially be felt in Europe with a large winter tourism industry. While the US Congress has just recently approved a more than $1 billion infrastructure stimulus package, the ongoing budgetary negotiations will need to be followed closely. The US administration wants to implement another multi-trillion dollar stimulus package, but with ongoing unresolved budgetary issues and the debt ceiling deadline of 3 December approaching, major uncertainties remain. In addition, central bank policies are pointing to continued tapering of the current monthly $120 billion quantitative easing measures after the US Federal Reserve announced a $15 billion tapering in at least November and December. A very important factor, global trade, continued its Graph 3 1: Global trade rebound, but retracted somewhat further, still % change y-o-y impacted by the base effect from last year.

Global trade volume Global trade value Sources: Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, Haver Analytics and OPEC. Near-term global expectations While the global economic recovery has continued, most recently, the combination of rising COVID-19 infections, supply chain issues and growing inflation has led to a slight slowdown that is forecast to materialize in 4Q21. The underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 and 2022 are so far largely unchanged. This includes, in particular, the assumption that COVID-19 remains well contained in the advanced economies in the sense that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current levels and that the pandemic will not pose a large obstacle to major emerging economies. In this respect and despite the rising infection rates especially the Euro-zone, no further significant lockdown measures are expected. In addition, tight labour markets are seen to be temporary, a factor that otherwise may lead to rising inflation at the global level as well. Finally, very high debt levels in both governments and the private sector could provide substantial challenges going forward, particularly in light of a possibly longer-dated rise in inflation and a consequent hike in global interest rates. While it currently seems that economic growth risks are tilted towards the downside, upside risks could materialize as well. Further stimulus measures in the US, a continued strong recovery in the Euro-zone and a solid rebound in Japan could lead to stronger-than-expected growth in these OECD economies. Moreover, China may overcome the soft patch in the 2H21 recovery through governmental support and ongoing export-driven momentum. India may also overcome the ongoing challenges by an improvement in domestic demand and a rebound in the export-driven services sector. With these base assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is estimated to stand at 0.8% q-o-q and at 1.1% q-o-q in 2Q21. Some global deceleration is estimated for the growth level in 3Q21, when GDP growth is forecast at 0.5% q-o-q, while 4Q21 growth is forecast at 1.8% q-o-q. The growth pattern in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally spread and in line with average historical patterns. Inflation is assumed to remain well anchored in the OECD, so that in 2022, these levels are forecast to stand at around 2% for OECD economies on average and around 2.5% for the US. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Economy Global purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) for Graph 3 2: Global PMI both the manufacturing and services sectors rose in Index October.

Considering the numerus counterbalancing Table 3 2: World economic growth rate and revision, developments in the global economy that have been 2021–2022*, % taken into consideration, the 2021 GDP growth World forecast remains unchanged from the previous 2021 5.6 month at 5.6%.

This implies that, among other issues, COVID-19-related challenges will not derail Source: OPEC. the recovery. An important assumption, especially for the 2022 forecast, is that inflation will not continue at the high 2H21 levels, particularly the US and the Euro-zone. While highly hypothetical, it was assumed in a high-inflationary scenario that global inflation would rise from the currently anticipated level of 3.4% to 4.5% in 2022, i.e. an extension of global inflation from 2H21 into 2022. In this scenario, global economic growth is assumed to fall back to around 2.9%, compared to the current base case of a GDP growth forecast for 2022 of 4.2%. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments After the strong momentum in 1H21, GDP growth was confirmed to have slowed down in 3Q21 in the US. 3Q21 GDP growth stood at only 2% q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), after 6.7% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In the meantime, ongoing COVID-19 related challenges, a tightening labour market, inflation and reported supply chain bottlenecks are indicators that 2H21 growth will likely be lower than 1H21 growth. After the US Congress approved more than $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus for infrastructure spending, the ongoing budget and fiscal stimulus discussions in the US Congress during the coming weeks will remain an important factor. Most of these fiscal issues will need to be resolved with the upcoming debt ceiling deadline in early December. Moreover, central bank policies are pointing to continued tapering of the current monthly $120 billion quantitative easing measures after the US Federal Reserve announced a monthly $15 billion tapering for at least November and December. Consumer confidence increased slightly in October, indicating some rebound in 4Q21. The index provided by the Conference Board showed an index level of 113.8 for October, compared with 109.8 in September and 115.2 in August. US inflation remained high at 5.4% in September, after 5.3% y-o-y in August. The strongest appreciation came once again from the sub-sector of transportation, pointing to the possibility of a transitory effect after the reopening of the economy. Prices in the transportation sector rose by 15.6% y-o-y in September, after 17.8% y-o-y in August and 19.4% y-o-y in July. Excluding the volatile components of energy and food, inflation stood at 4% in September, the same level as in August and compared with 4.3% y-o-y in July. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 13 World Economy The unemployment rate fell again to stand at only Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market 4.6% in October, compared with 4.8% in September % % and 5.2% in August.

Near-term expectations Near-term expectations continue to be impacted by some slowing momentum as confirmed by the latest 3Q21 GDP growth figures. Positively, however, the current quarter’s growth levels are forecast to increase with support from rising consumer confidence and the need to replenish inventories in 4Q21. The draw-down from inventories was significant in 2Q21, and inventories will likely be replenished in 2H21. Supply chains, however, will need to be monitored as an ongoing shortage of vital input goods like semiconductors could dampen this expectation. Another aspect that will play an important role in the near-term recovery is the labour market trend as it remains to be seen if job seekers will re-enter the job market. The latest job additions point to a continued improvement in the labour market in 4Q21. Further fiscal stimulus – still under negotiation – and beyond the latest infrastructure package may provide an additional upside to the growth forecast. In terms of quarterly growth developments, 1Q21 GDP growth stood at 6.3% q-o-q SAAR, and 2Q21 growth was reported at 6.7% q-o-q SAAR, while 3Q21 slowed down to 2% q-o-q SAAR, based on BEA numbers. With expectations for inventory restocking in 4Q21, ongoing fiscal stimulus measures and a rebound in consumer confidence, growth levels for 2H21 and 2022 are forecast to remain sound. Growth in 4Q21 is forecast to reach 4.6% q-o-q SAAR, the same level as last month. Quarterly growth in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally distributed. The October PMI levels as provided by the Institute Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and for Supply Management (ISM) point to an ongoing non-manufacturing indices recovery. The index level for the services sector, Index representing around 70% of the US economy, rose 70 significantly. It stood at 66.7 compared with 61.9 in 65 66.7 September and 61.7 in August. The manufacturing 60 PMI remained almost unchanged in October to stand 60.8 55 at 60.8, after 61.1 in September and 59.9 in August. 50 45 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 ISM manufacturing index ISM non-manufacturing index Sources: Institute for Supply Management and Haver Analytics. 14 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Economy Taking the somewhat slowing 2H21 momentum into Table 3 3: US economic growth rate and revision, account, the 2021 US GDP growth forecast was 2021–2022*, % revised down slightly to stand at 5.5% compared with US 5.8% in the previous month.

This will Source: OPEC. be accompanied not only by accommodative monetary policy but also by further fiscal stimulus and inventory restocking. Growth in 2022 is forecast to normalize but will continue to be very well supported by fiscal stimulus, as well as ongoing accommodative monetary policies. These supporting factors and ongoing momentum are forecast to lift growth to 4.1%, unchanged from the previous month. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, but also supply chain issues and inflation, remain. As the US is currently at the heart of the inflation discussion, it was assumed in a scenario that price rises of the CPI, also driven by wage inflation, are leading to an annual general CPI of 4.1% in 2022. This would be a continuation of the average 2021 CPI index level increase and compares to a base case assumption of 2.6%. While it is hard to predict, focusing on the US developments and considering only moderate channel effects and more gradual price rises in other major economies, the impacts on growth may be considerable, also as the Fed would need to respond earlier than currently foreseen. In such a high US inflation scenario, US growth would stand at 3.3% in 2022, compared with the base case of 4.1%, and global growth would be lower at 3.8%, compared with 4.2% in the base case. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Euro-zone continued to see very strong growth in 3Q21, a continuation of the considerable 2Q21 momentum following a decline in 1Q21. Growth stood at 9.1% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21, an even stronger acceleration than the already strong 8.7% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21, as reported by Eurostat, the EU statistical office. The ongoing impetus is supported by pent-up demand after the easing of lockdowns towards the end of 2Q21. Moreover, the combination of fiscal stimulus and the continuing accommodative monetary policy has lifted both consumption and investment. The global trade recovery has been another supportive factor, especially for major exporters, such as Germany, France and Italy. It remains to be seen whether this momentum will endure into 4Q21, particularly given the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in some economies that underlines that the pandemic is far from over in the euro-zone. Similarly to other OECD economies, inflation rose further in October and September. While this may lead to a gradually less accommodative monetary policy in the near term, the European Central Bank (ECB) currently appears to be willing to continue its current monetary stimulus. It is clear that inflationary developments have been further accentuated by global supply issues that have led to price rises for input goods, which has especially impacted the manufacturing sector. The car sectors in Germany, France and Spain, were particularly hard hit. Passenger car production in Germany declined again in October with output falling y-o-y by 35.5%, albeit this drop was lower than in September when production fell by y-o-y 44.2%, according to the German car industry association, the Verband der Automobilindustrie. Positively, improvements in the labour market have continued, while consumer confidence fell slightly again in October amid the ongoing rise in COVID-19 infections The ECB has maintained its accommodative monetary policies for the time being and while inflation has continued to rise, the ECB appears to view it as a temporary phenomenon given the latest comments from officials. Inflation in the Euro-zone rose to 4.1% y-o-y in October, after having reached 3.5% y-o-y in September. This was up from 3.2% in August. When excluding volatile items such as food and energy, inflation stood at 2.2% y-o-y in October. This is up from a level of 2% y-o-y in September and 1.9% y-o-y in August. On a positive note, supported by the ECB’s accommodative monetary policies, lending to the private sector by financial institutions held up well in September, rising by 2.6% y-o-y after an increase of 2.2% y-o-y in August. However, the largest rise in lending activity continues to be seen in the real estate sector. Lending to OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 15 World Economy non-financial corporations rebounded and stood at 0.9% y-o-y in September, after only a 0.1% increase y-o-y in August. The labour market continued to see improvements. According to the latest numbers from Eurostat, the unemployment rate stood at 7.4% in September, compared with 7.5% in August, 7.6% in July and 7.8% y-o-y in June, and down from 8% in May.

Sources: Statistical Office of the European Communities and Haver Analytics. Near-term expectations After very strong growth in 2Q21 and an acceleration into 3Q21, growth is forecast to slow towards the end of the year. This somewhat softer dynamic is then expected to continue into 1Q22. The mid-year 2021 trend was supported by pent-up demand after the end of lockdown measures and a recovery in contact-intensive sectors. However, the rise in COVID-19 infections in recent weeks, in combination with the supply constraints affecting semiconductors, gas supplies and other input goods, will likely dampen the growth dynamic. With regard to the pandemic, it remains to be seen whether vaccination rates will achieve sufficient levels in the autumn and winter to prevent the further spread of new variants. There are still numerous economies that have a vaccination rate below 70%. Ongoing fiscal stimulus and the continued accommodative ECB monetary policies are forecast to counterbalance some of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 situation in 4Q21. Based on the latest 1H21 revisions, the quarterly forecast has been updated with further emphasis on growth in 2Q21 and 3Q21. The underlying assumptions for the rest of the year and 2022 have not changed. It is anticipated that COVID-19 containment efforts in 4Q21 and beyond will be effective enough to support the recovery and not derail the economy. Moreover, supply chain issues are expected to be temporary in nature and not negatively impact growth. Importantly, no major lockdown measures are forecast in the Euro-zone for 4Q21 and 1Q22. After reported growth of -1.2% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q21 and 8.7% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21, GDP growth in 3Q21 reached 9.1% q-o-q SAAR, slightly above the 2Q21 level. In 4Q21, growth is forecast at 2.4% q-o-q SAAR, compared with a forecast of 3.2% q-o-q SAAR in the previous month. The October PMI for the Euro-zone economy pointed Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs to an ongoing recovery in manufacturing and services Index sectors, albeit at a slower pace than in previous 70 months. The PMI for services, the largest sector in the Euro-zone, retracted to 54.6, compared with 56.4 in 58.3 60 September and 59 in August. The manufacturing PMI retracted slightly to stand at 58.3 in October compared 54.6 to 58.6 in September and 61.4 in August. 50 40 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit and Haver Analytics. 16 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Economy As the easing of lockdown measures has led to a Table 3 4: Euro-zone economic growth rate and stronger-than-expected recovery in 3Q21, 2021 GDP revision, 2021–2022*, % growth has been revised up to 5.1%, compared with Euro-zone 5% last month.

OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments The Japanese economy has been impacted by the social-distancing measures seen in 3Q21, including emergency measures in Tokyo and other major prefectures. Emergency measures designed to fight the pandemic were lifted only at the end of September. Alongside supply chain issues, this has led to a slowing momentum in 3Q21. Sentiment indices, however, point to a recovery in 4Q21, also these are supported by rising vaccination rates with more than 70% now having received at least one vaccination. The election outcome, confirming governmental policies, with the Conservative LDP along with its coalition partner retaining control of parliament, leads to an expectation of a continuation of supportive economic measures. On the negative side, the ongoing supply issues that are significantly impacting the auto sector, among others, could continue to be a drag on 4Q21 growth. However, some trade indicators show an easing of the tightening supply environment. Industrial production (IP) declined in September on a yearly basis. This is even more important to note as it compares to an already largely impaired level in the last year. The drop in September stood at 2.4% y-o-y, compared with a rise of 6% y-o-y in August and 13% y-o-y in July. On a monthly basis, IP actually fell by 5.8% y-o-y in September, after a decline of 3.5% in August. Impacted by the strong declines in IP, exports in Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports September retracted considerably too.

Haver Analytics. On a positive note, consumer confidence points to a 4Q21 recovery. The consumer confidence index level, as reported by the Cabinet Office, rose to 39.2 in October, compared with 37.9 in September and 36.4 in August. This points to a rebound in domestic consumption, which is likely to be supported by further stimulus measures. Near-term expectations After the weakness in 3Q21, Japan’s economic trend is forecast to rebound in 4Q21. With rising vaccination rates and generally low infection levels, and with the economy likely to be supported by further stimulus measures, the near term forecast appears to be well supported. However, the trend will evidently depend on supply-chain developments and COVID-19-related issues. By taking into consideration a lower 3Q21 GDP growth assumption, impacted by social distancing measures, the GDP growth forecast for 2021 has been slightly lowered. As reported by Japan’s statistical office, 1Q21 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 17 World Economy GDP declined by 4.2% q-o-q SAAR. Despite the lockdown measures in 2Q21, growth was reported to have recovered and reached 1.9% q-o-q SAAR. Quarterly growth in 3Q21 and 4Q21 should then pick up further. Growth is forecast at 2.8% q-o-q SAAR in 3Q21, albeit below the estimate of 3.3% q-o-q SAAR in the previous MOMR. The rebound in 4Q21 was also revised down slightly to stand at 4.5% q-o-q SAAR, compared with an estimate of 5% q-o-q SAAR in the October publication. The gradual rebound in the economy’s services sector Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs is also reflected in the October PMI, which rose Index above the growth indicating 50-level for the first time 55 53.2 since the start of the pandemic. The PMI for the services sector, which constitutes around two-thirds 50.7 50 of the Japanese economy, rose significantly to 50.7, compared with 47.8 in September.

Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s economy advanced by 4.9% y-o-y, the slowest pace of expansion since 3Q20 amid several headwinds, including a power crisis, supply chain bottlenecks, a persistent property bubble as well as ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks in major regions.

Near-term expectations China’s economic outlook has been bearish amid the lingering effects of ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks combined with supply chain disruptions. The strict “zero-tolerance” approach may have also weighed on household consumption at a time when electricity shortages are disrupting manufacturing output and government-housing control policies are weighing on property investment. This may still open a window for more policy support as policymakers need to maintain balance and shore up short-term growth. This might include securing liquidity in the interbank market, boosting infrastructure development and easing some credit and real estate regulations. However, policymakers may face a critical challenge in finding the right balance between controlling the latest COVID-19 outbreaks and maintaining normal economic activities.

Latin America Brazil Update on latest developments Despite GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels and most economic activities continuing to show resilient economic momentum, Brazil’s economic recovery is highly challenged by inflationary pressures, unemployment and public debt. Indeed, unemployment rates are still well above pre-pandemic levels, remaining at 13.2% for the three-month average ending August 2021. This might indicate that household spending continued to depend on government cash transfers. Yet the window to increase public spending is very narrow as the public debt level is at a record high. Moreover, the recent questioning regarding the fiscal framework following a presidential proposal to change the rules for calculating the spending cap law was received negatively by investors that saw the proposal as a political step ahead of next year’s elections. In the meantime, inflationary pressure — the result Graph 3 16: Brazil’s inflation vs. interest rate of currency depreciation coupled with a severe % change y-o-y % per annum drought in previous months and an ongoing global 15 10 supply bottleneck — increased to a new high level of 11.08 8 11.08% in October from 10.78% in September, the 10 6 highest inflation rate since February of 2016. 7.75 5 4 In response to inflationary concerns, the central bank 2 raised the Selic rate for the sixth time this year to 0 0 stand at 7.75% in October and will probably tighten it Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 more sharply in an effort to anchor inflation expectations for the coming two years.

Near-term expectations In 4Q21, Brazil’s economy may remain resilient, however, political instability related to the 2022 election along with the ongoing global supply disruptions, in addition to a new wave of CO|VID-19 might dampen the 2022 outlook. The accelerated the pace of vaccination, with 70% of the adult population expected to be vaccinated by the end of 2021, should further support a full reopening of the economy. Nevertheless, elevated inflation rates could continue to be a major drag on the economic recovery. 22 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Economy Recent composite PMIs suggested that the private Graph 3 17: Brazil’s PMIs service sector continued to expand, but Index manufacturing sector growth might slow down.

Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments At the beginning of 3Q21, South Africa eased the COVID-19 lockdown to “adjusted level 1” following the rapid decline in new infections. This boosted positive economic sentiments, yet the recent wave of COVID-19 globally and locally may challenge the economic recovery in 4Q21. In September, the annual inflation rate accelerated for the second month in a raw to 5% from 4.9% in August, above the 4.5% midpoint target from the South African Reserve Bank. Upward pressure mainly came from transport prices, particularly fuels. Yet, on a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up in September by only 0.2% compared to a 0.4% gain in the prior month. Responding to inflationary pressures, the South Africa Reserve Bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged in September at a record low level of 3.5%. Moreover, the bank revised its CPI forecast for 2021 up to 4.4% from 4.3% and kept the 2022 and 2023 CPI forecasts unchanged at 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the official GDP forecast for 2021 was raised to 5.3% from 4.2%. However, the forecast for 2022 was lowered to 1.7% from 2.3% and for 2023 to 1.8% from 2.4%. Official labour market data suggested that the unemployment rate registered a record high of 34.4% in 2Q21 following 32.6% in 1Q21. This was the highest jobless rate since comparable data started to be released in 2008. The expanded definition of unemployment stood at 44.4%, up from 43.2% in 1Q21. In 2Q21, the youth unemployment rate hit a record high of 64.4%. External demand continued to support the economic recovery, yet the trade surplus narrowed to ZAR22.2 billion in September from a revised ZAR42.3 billion in August. Exports dropped 1% to ZAR157 billion. Imports, on the other hand, increased 15.9% to ZAR134.8 billion. Near-term expectations In the near term, the outlook for South Africa’s economy is skewed more to the positive side, but it is still challenged by COVID-19 infections and vaccination developments. Moreover, recent political instability, along with headwinds in main trading partner China, could have a significant impact on the economy in 2H21. Despite overall positive sentiment, the seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 53.6 in October from the September downwardly revised reading of 54.7. Nevertheless, it was still within the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 23 World Economy expansionary territory for a third consecutive month. Meanwhile, the drop in daily COVID-19 infections and the easing of lockdown restrictions might help provide balance to weaker manufacturing growth.

The ministry of economic development monthly GDP tracker indicates that in September the economy advanced by 3.5% compared with 3.7% in August. Industrial production grew by 6.8% y-o-y in September, following a 4.6% gain in August, marking the seventh straight month of growth in industrial output. Retail sales also grew by 5.6% y-o-y in September, advancing from 5.3% y-o-y in August. Labour market pressures eased as well, while the unemployment rate slightly dropped to 4.3% in September from 4.4% in the August. Meanwhile, real wages increased by 1.5% y-o-y in August following 2.2% y-o-y in July. Nonetheless, the inflation rate kept elevating, Graph 3 18: Russia’s inflation vs. interest rate reaching 8.13% in October from 7.4% in September, % In response, the Central Bank of the Russian 9 8.1 Federation (CBR) increased the benchmark policy 8 rate by 0.75 bps to 7.5% in October — the highest 7 interest rate since June 2019.

Near-term expectations With increasing fossil fuel prices, Russia’s economic outlook looks rather optimistic, despite a rise in COVID19 infections. The economy is back to pre-pandemic levels, but uncertainties related to current global supply chain disruptions and a slow rate of vaccination might hinder this progress. More importantly, the latest inflation data may indicate another downside recovery risk, as it may lead to secondary effects, especially in the coming year, such as a lowering of individual savings and exports. 24 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Economy Recent PMI indictors carried mixed signals, as the Graph 3 19: Russia’s PMI manufacturing PMI increased to 51.6 in October from Index 49.8 in September, marking the first expansion of the 60 manufacturing sector since May.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, real GDP advanced by 5.8%, the highest growth rate since 4Q10. Despite the October 2021 PMI indicator slipping to 57.7 from 58.6 in September, it still implies that the recovery from COVID-19 continues to materialize in the non-oil sector, with overall business sentiment strong compared to the 2020 average. Nigeria Nigeria’s Stanbic IBTC Bank PMI improved to 54.1 in October 2021 from 52.3 in September. This was the sixteenth successive monthly expansion. Overall output, new orders and buying activity rose sharply. The annual inflation rate eased to 16.6% in September, down from about 17 % in August. The September level is the lowest inflation rate since January 2021 amid a moderation in food inflation. Despite a deceleration in inflation, the Central Bank of Nigeria kept its monetary policy rate unchanged at 11.5% at its September 2021 meeting with a focus on supporting the domestic economic recovery. The Bank has revised down its 2021 growth projections to 2.9%, from 3.2% in July, which compares to the International Monetary Fund’s expectation of 2.5%.

The PMI accelerated to 55.7 in October 2021 from September’s low reading of 53.3, with the Dubai Expo 2020 that began in October providing a boost. The UAE’s economy is anticipated to achieve a strong recovery in 2H21 boosted by Expo 2020, yet it may still be challenged by the risk associated with the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. For the time being, the government is expected to continue to provide significant fiscal support for the economy in both the shortand long-run, such as with ‘Operation Dh300bn’ and the ‘2040 Master Plan’. Additionally, the UAE government continues to provide support for new sectors, such as the digital economy and creative industries, which is expected to further boost the recovery in both the shortand medium-term.

In addition, a slowdown in the pace of recovery in 4Q21 is now assumed due to elevated energy prices. World total oil demand is now estimated to reach 96.4 mb/d in 2021. In the OECD, 2021 oil demand estimates were revised marginally lower by around 0.04 mb/d compared to last month’s projections despite upward revisions to 1Q21 data. Oil demand recovery momentum softened in the following quarters on the back of slower-than-anticipated requirements for industrial and transportation fuels. OECD oil demand projections in 4Q21 were also adjusted lower taking into consideration down revisions in the region’s economic outlook, high energy prices and uptick in COVID-19 cases. In the non-OECD, oil demand was revised lower by 0.12 mb/d compared to last month’s report. A wave of COVID-19 infections that forced targeted lockdown measures, as well as weaker manufacturing output and power sector challenges in China, have reduced 3Q21 transportation and industrial fuels demand in contrast to initial expectations. India’s oil demand in 3Q21 was also adjusted lower due to a slower recovery in the demand for industrial fuels. Some of this slower momentum is now projected to spill over into the following quarters. In 2022, oil demand growth was kept unchanged compared to the previous month’s forecasts, to stand at 4.2 mb/d. World total demand is now estimated to reach 100.6 mb/d around 0.5 mb/d above 2019’s levels. However, some minor opposing revisions were considered, mainly taking into account adjustments to macroeconomic projections and challenges affecting demand performance in the world’s main consuming centres. Thus, marginal upward revisions in OECD Europe, due to better economic views in some European countries, were offset by softer growth in industrial fuel demand in OECD America and Latin America. Gasoline and diesel are projected to record the highest gains in 2022 in both the OECD and non-OECD. Gasoline is projected to increase the most in the US followed by China and India while OECD Americas and Europe are assumed to have the lion’s share of diesel growth. Despite increasing y-o-y, reductions in intercontinental flights are assumed to pressure the jet fuel recovery in 2022 and push the full recovery to pre-pandemic levels beyond next year. From a regional perspective, OECD Americas and China are anticipated to lead demand growth next year on the back of healthy economic outlooks, controlled COVID-19 cases and stable petrochemicals sector demand.

In terms of the oil demand level, August 0 appears to have recovered to 96%, while during the first eight months of 2021 the recovery stood at only -2 43%. Gasoline demand grew for the sixth month in a -4 -3.0 row, rising by 0.7 mb/d y-o-y. Oil demand remained lower than August 2019 levels by 1.2 mb/d. All -6 countries in the region posted demand gains on top of 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year a lower baseline during 2020. 2020 2021* 2022* Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. The latest available US monthly demand data for August imply strong demand growth of approximately 1.9 mb/d y-o-y, making up 75% of losses incurred in August 2020 but remaining lower from August 2019 by 0.6 mb/d. LPG, gasoline, jet kerosene and diesel requirements contributed the most to the bulk of increases, with LPG and gasoline gaining in August 2021 by 0.4 and 0.6 mb/d y-o-y, while jet kerosene increased by 0.6 mb/d and diesel 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y. The demand for gasoline, jet kerosene and diesel fell during August 2020 by 1.3 mb/d, 0.8 mb/d and 0.4 mb/d y-o-y respectively. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHA), vehicle miles of travel in the US increased by 8.5% y-o-y in August after rising by 13.0% y-o-y in July. In August 2020, the indicator fell by 11.3% y-o-y. Light vehicle retail sales, as reported by Autodata and Haver Analytics, were at 13.2 million units in August of the current year, according to seasonally adjusted annual rates (SAAR), compared with 14.8 million units in July, 15.4 million units in August 2020 and 17.2 million units in August 2019. Industrial production was also higher by 5.6% y-o-y in August after increasing by 6.9% y-o-y in July. Preliminary data for September based on weekly data indicates a continuation of a recovery in transportation fuel performance, with both gasoline and jet kerosene demand increasing by more than 1.3 mb/d y-o-y in total. 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Oil Demand Table 4 3: US oil demand, mb/d Change Aug 21/Aug 20 By product Aug 20 Aug 21 Growth % LPG 2.71 3.09 0.38 13.9 Naphtha 0.20 0.18 -0.02 -8.0 Gasoline 8.52 9.11 0.59 6.9 Jet/kerosene 1.03 1.58 0.55 54.0 Diesel 3.67 3.89 0.22 5.9 Fuel oil 0.31 0.35 0.04 13.7 Other products 2.41 2.60 0.19 8.0 Total 18.85 20.80 1.95 10.4 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding.

Near-term expectations Going forward, risks related to COVID-19 developments during the emergence of colder weather, as well as possible economic-related challenges are assumed to soften transportation and industrial fuels recovery in 4Q21. On the other hand, transportation fuels performance, including gasoline, is linked to gasoline retail prices, which currently are assumed to be marginal amid large stimulus packages and high household savings. Risks associated to potential changes in consumer behaviour amid structural impact of COVID-19, as well as the emergence of COVID-19 treatments are to be monitored closely going forward. In 2022, OECD Americas oil demand will be supported by solid economic growth and is expected to rise by around 1.1 mb/d y-o-y with the US oil demand accounting for 0.9 mb/d y-o-y. The petrochemical and transportation sectors will drive oil demand during 2022. Despite the ongoing penetration of alternative fuelled cars and increasing efficiencies, gasoline demand will be backed by increases in vehicle sales. Several expansions in the petrochemical industry will provide support to light distillates demand growth in 2022. Downside risks relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic challenges, in particular inflation and supply chain.

Near-term expectations The 3Q21 has contributed significantly to oil demand developments, however, going forward, COVID-19 challenges are assumed to partially cap oil demand in 4Q21. Generally, the outlook for the region’s oil demand in 2021 remains optimistic amid COVID-19 containment efforts and increasing vaccination rates, and despite rising cases in some countries of the region. Transportation fuels are anticipated to lead the recovery going into the final part of the year with factors such as, economic challenges, high energy prices and winter conditions are to be closely monitored. In 2022, OECD Europe oil demand is expected to rise by around 0.6 mb/d. The positive projections for the economy and progress in controlling COVID-19 are the main supporting factors in 2022, bolstered by improvements in mobility and positive developments in the industrial and construction sectors. Downside risks pertain to COVID-19, high debt levels, inflation as well as national budgetary constraints.

The removal of lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand are expected to support oil demand for the remainder of 2021. Overall demand in 2021 in the region is projected to increase y-o-y, with petrochemical feedstock as one of the main contributors to oil demand growth. In 2022, OECD Asia Pacific oil demand is projected to increase by 0.2 mb/d, in line with healthy GDP growth and despite rising fuel efficiencies and fuel substitution. Fuel substitution may also provide support to oil demand as a result of high natural gas prices. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments Oil demand in China grew by a marginal 0.1 mb/d in September compared to a 0.3 mb/d y-o-y increase in August. Demand was impacted by localised lockdowns and slower-than-expected economic momentum. Middle distillates were affected the most and declined sharply y-o-y. Both jet/kerosene and diesel showed significant drops of more than 0.5 mb/d y-o-y, offset by strong fuel oil gains and healthy petrochemical feedstock demand. Fuel oil posted strong gains of around 0.3 mb/d y-o-y, Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change matching the August gains, and high natural gas mb/d prices supported additional fuel oil demand in the 2 power generation sector.

Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand growth is anticipated to increase in 4Q21 albeit at a slower pace than last month’s projections. Localised COVID-19 containment measures in parts of the country and economic challenges led to this downward revision for China in 4Q21. Some spill-over effects are anticipated for 1H22 oil demand. However, demand is projected to show respectable growth in 2021 supported by healthy y-o-y performance in various economic sectors. The transportation, petrochemical and industrial sectors are assumed to stimulate demand for petroleum products led by gasoline and diesel. LPG and naphtha will record positive gains going forward, due to healthy petrochemical margins and recent capacity development. In 2022, China’s oil demand is anticipated to increase by more than 0.7 mb/d, unchanged from last month projections, mainly supported by steady economic momentum and despite rising challenges which will require close monitoring. Oil demand for the transportation and industrial sectors is projected to rise, buoyed by firm increases in mobility, rising passenger car sales and a healthy industrial sector. However, issues related to high energy prices, supply chain challenges and COVID-19 developments will put downward pressure on oil demand particularly during 1H22.

Near-term expectations Going forward, the economic outlook remains positive for the final quarter of the year, supported by efforts to control COVID-19 infections and steady industrial sector gains. However, high energy prices, which require close monitoring over the next months, are a concern when it comes to consumer spending and subsequently oil consumption. Nevertheless, oil demand is expected to continue to grow in 4Q21, supported by the low baseline and an uptick in diesel demand in the construction and agricultural sectors. The recovery in transportation fuels is anticipated to continue, though it remains dependent on developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for transportation fuel will lead product demand, followed by middle distillates for the remainder of 2021. In 2022, similar to last month’s expectations, 1Q22 Indian oil demand estimates are at around 0.5 mb/d with 2022 annualized growth expected at around 0.4 mb/d y-o-y. Total volumes are expected to exceed prepandemic levels on an annualized basis by more than 0.3 mb/d. Regarding products, gasoline is anticipated to be the strongest product in 2022, supported by an acceleration in mobility, an uptick in vehicle sales and overall steady economic growth. Diesel is assumed to be supported by healthy growth in the industrial, construction and agricultural sectors during 2022. Latin America Update on the latest developments Following six months of steady growth, oil demand in Latin America continued to record respectable growth in August. Demand for petroleum products was higher by more than 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in August, compared with an increase of around 0.4 mb/d y-o-y in July. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in August 2019, Graph 4 6: Latin America’s oil demand, y-o-y demand fell by more than 0.1 mb/d in the whole change region. August’s rise in oil consumption was mainly mb/d supported by transportation fuels recovering from the 1.0 low base of last year and some uptick in mobility data, particularly in Brazil. Mobility in Latin America 0.5 0.3 exceeded pre-pandemic levels and was at 104%, 0.2 according to Google maps and Apple mobility 0.0 indicators, following 102% in July and 95% in June. Gasoline and jet fuel recorded gains of around -0.5 0.2 mb/d y-o-y collectively after posting similar gains -0.6 in July. Both fuels remained 0.1 mb/d below prepandemic level. Diesel demand was driven by stable -1.0 industrial and agricultural demand.

The latest available data for Brazil indicates an increase of more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in September. This is a deceleration in the pace of growth as compared to recent months when demand was increasing by 0.2-0.3 mb/d. However, the baseline effect and slower diesel growth largely impacted the level of growth. Transportation fuels continued to recover, particularly gasoline, showing steady y-o-y gains. Both gasoline and jet fuels posted gains of more around 0.1 mb/d with gasoline exceeding pre-pandemic consumption.

Near-term expectations Going forward, drought-related impacts on hydropower production should encourage fuel oil consumption and thus support oil demand. Additionally, accelerated vaccination programmes and steady economic momentum should boost demand in the coming months. COVID-19-related risks and uncertainties related to next year’s general elections put downward pressure on the forecast. Gasoline, jet fuel and diesel are expected to be affected the most. In 2022, oil demand in Latin America is expected to rise y-o-y consistent with the better economic outlook and despite marginal downward revision due to adjustment in macroeconomic outlook. All countries are anticipated to show steady oil demand growth, with Brazil leading the region as in recent years.

Diesel was higher by nearly 0.1 mb/d y-o-y while LPG and naphtha both increased by around the same levels. The increase in diesel demand is supported by an uptick in construction and truck movements mainly in Saudi Arabia. The latest data for September indicates a continuation of rising demand in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Demand increased in both countries by a similar level (0.01 mb/d y-o-y) and was driven by strong fuel oil demand primarily in the industrial and power generation sectors. Fuel oil gained around 0.05 mb/d y-o-y in each country. 34 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Oil Demand Transportation fuel also supported this increase, particularly in Saudi Arabia as demand for gasoline and jet fuel increased by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y.

Near-term expectations The recent announcements that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE would relax COVID-19 measures and the return of normality almost to pre-pandemic levels, oil demand is anticipated to be very well supported in the 4Q21 and going into 2022. Risks of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases will remain a concern, however, but the sound management of the pandemic over the past few months will minimize the impact on oil demand. Infrastructure projects and healthy petrochemical sectors are assumed to provide solid support to oil demand in the coming months. In 2022, oil demand is anticipated to increase by 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in 1Q22 and is projected to rise by similar levels on an annualized basis. The positive economic outlook and management of the COVID-19 pandemic are main drivers for oil demand next year. Gasoline, diesel and light distillates are anticipated to be the leading products supporting oil demand growth in 2022. Saudi Arabia is expected to provide the largest share of oil demand growth in the region, supported by the healthy economic outlook, well-managed COVID-19 efforts and the expanding petrochemical sector. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 35 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 (including processing gains by 0.13 mb/d) remains unchanged at 0.7 mb/d y-o-y growth to average 63.6 mb/d. The minor upward revisions to liquids supply of the US, Canada, Mexico, and China in 3Q21, were offset by downward revisions in the supply forecast of other countries. The US liquids supply forecast was revised up by 19 tb/d following higher than expected output of NGLs in August by 113 tb/d, m-o-m, to average 5.6 mb/d. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, Russia, China, Norway, Brazil, Guyana, and Qatar, while output is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Indonesia and Egypt. Non-OPEC supply growth for 2022 also remains unchanged at 3.0 mb/d y-o-y, and averages 66.7 mb/d. Following plans to increase natural gas production, US liquids supply is now forecast to grow by 0.9 mb/d due to higher NGLs production by 0.3 mb/d. However, this increase is offset by downward revisions in the supply forecasts of Norway, Mexico, India, and Asia others. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are expected to be Russia (1.0 mb/d) and the US (0.9 mb/d), followed by Brazil, Canada, Norway, Kazakhstan and Guyana. Nevertheless, investment levels, particularly in the US shale sector, remain a concern. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 was revised down by 15 tb/d due to lowerthan-expected output in 2H21, to now stand at growth of 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, to average 5.2 mb/d and to grow by 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in 2022, to average 5.3 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in October increased by 0.22 mb/d m-o-m to average 27.45 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids production in October, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have grown by 1.5 mb/d m-o-m to average 70.1 mb/d, up by 3.7 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply in October has grown by 1.74 mb/d m-o-m to average 97.56 mb/d, up by 6.74 mb/d y-o-y.

Moreover, lower-than-expected oil output in Norway in 3Q21, led to a downward adjustment of a minor 4 tb/d. In the non-OECD, while the supply growth forecast of China was revised up by 7 tb/d on higher-than-expected output in 3Q21, the supply forecast of Malaysia revised down by 6 tb/d due to lower output in 3Q21. 36 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 World Oil Supply The non-OPEC supply growth forecast for 2022 Graph 5 2: Major revisions to annual supply also remained unchanged at 3.02 mb/d. change forecast in 2022*, November MOMR/October Nevertheless, US liquids supply was revised up by MOMR 115 tb/d to stand at 0.94 mb/d, y-o-y, due to the reassessment of NGLs output, which is now forecast at US 115 0.3 mb/d.

Further declines in refinery processing rates attributed to peak maintenance season weighed on product inventory levels and continued to keep product balances tight. This drove middle distillates to retain their position as the strongest margin contributors in the Atlantic Basin. In Asia, sustained fuel demand amid supressed product exports from China, as they focus on supplying the national market amid the countrywide energy crises, kept refinery intakes in China somewhat limited. This ultimately led to considerable Asian fuel markets support, particularly those linked to the top and middle sections of the barrel. Refinery margins US Gulf Coast (USGC) refining margins increased, Graph 6 1: Refining margins and extended the gains witnessed in the previous US$/b month, as a robust performance from the middle 20 section of the barrel provided support and offset the weakness from the top and bottom sections of the 15 barrel. USGC refinery margins in October averaged 10 $16.89/b, which was the highest level seen since October 2019. The middle distillates tightness, 5 combined with declines in refinery outputs during the month due to peak refinery maintenance season, 0 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 drove gasoil and jet fuel markets to strengthen. Additional support emerged from Brazil, as demand for gasoil in power generation firmed up, backed by WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) low hydropower generation capacity following severe Oman (Singapore) droughts. Sources: Argus and OPEC. On the other hand, gasoline cracks in October showed losses, weighed down by the seasonal slowdown in gasoline demand. Similarly, USGC fuel markets linked to the bottom of the barrel also came under heavy demand side pressure, despite a tightening balance. USGC margins against WTI averaged $16.89/b in October, up by $1.14 m-o-m and by $11.04/b y-o-y. Refinery margins in Europe rose and benefitted from firm product demand, growing product tightness in the region, as well as a fall in product output due to heavy maintenance works. In addition, healthy European industrial activity, as well as strong manufacturing output, continued to boost gasoil performance, and drove European gasoil crack spreads to a $3.42 m-o-m gain, which represented the second largest monthly rise in European product crack spreads across the barrel. At the same time strong revival in aviation fuel requirements attributed to a recovery in air travel drove jet/kerosene markets to outperform that of gasoil with a $3.71/b m-o-m gain in October. Natural gas prices in October remained high and limited refinery profits as units such as hydrocracking and hydro-treating were affected by high electricity costs. This situation was reported to have prompted run rate adjustments in some refineries in Europe in order to minimize the negative impact, which likely provided some short-term backing to refining economics. European refinery run rates in October decreased by 290 tb/d m-o-m, according to preliminary data, in response to the peak maintenance season in the region. In the near term, offline capacity is expected to lose momentum in line with historical trends, which could provide supply-side pressure to European product markets in the coming month. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $5.90/b in October, up by $1.42 compared with a month earlier and $3.99 y-o-y. In Asia, margins showed the strongest gains relative to the other regions, supported by rising gasoil margins as the recovery in the global economy stimulated product demand. Gasoil markets, in particular, benefited also from strong requirements from the power generator sector and gasoil was sought after as a more viable fuel alternative, given the record-high natural gas and coal prices. Rising industrial consumption, as economies reopen from COVID-19 restrictions, provided stimulus to product markets, while key consuming nations, such as India, posted a boost in fuel sales back to pre-COVID levels throughout the month of October. This led to a 68% rise, m-o-m in gasoil crack spreads in Singapore against Dubai. In addition, a power shortage in China, caused by policies for lower emission targets, high thermal coal and natural gas prices have, on the one hand, limited Chinese refinery runs nationwide, while, on the other hand, heightened fuel demand amid the energy OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations crises provided notable support to middle distillate markets within the region. Moreover, the recent curb on refinery runs aimed at removing excess fuel output, amid the reductions in crude oil import quotas as well as refined fuel exports seen in the recent months amid a hefty import tax for diesel blending components, further tightened fuel supplies, particularly that of diesel. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia gained $1.68 m-o-m to average $6.34/b in October, which was higher by $5.18 y-o-y. Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates decreased in October to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 85.5%, which corresponds to a throughput of % 15.50 mb/d. This represented a decline of 0.7 pp and 100 120 tb/d, respectively, compared with the previous 90 month. Y-o-y, the October refinery utilization rate was up by 10.2 pp, with throughput showing a rise of 80 1.6 mb/d. 70 European refinery utilization averaged 77.1%, 60 corresponding to a throughput of 9.19 mb/d.

Meanwhile, they were up y-o-y by 0.7 pp and 381 tb/d. Product markets US market US gasoline crack spreads declined for the second Graph 6 3: US Gulf crack spread vs. WTI consecutive month, pressured by the seasonal US$/b slowdown in gasoline demand. Although gasoline 30 inventory levels continued to fall, expectations of 20 seasonally lower demand going forward overshadowed the support from a tightening balance. 10 At the same time, US gasoline prices climbed to a new multi-year record high, up by $8.65 to settle at 0 $106.51/b, in response to the narrowing gasoline balance in the country and higher crude prices. The -10 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 US gasoline crack spreads lost $1.25 m-o-m to average $25.15/b in October, but were up by $13.33 y-o-y. Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene Diesel Fuel oil Sources: Argus and OPEC. USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads rose in October to become the second best performer m-o-m across the barrel in the country, as jet fuel production rates declined m-o-m. A deliberate shift to maximize gasoil yields by US refiners, given that it was the product affected the hardest by unplanned weather-related outages witnessed in the recent weeks, likely added to the jet/kerosene bullishness. Furthermore, announced plans to relax air travel restrictions and allow foreign nationals to enter the US led to a jump in European flight bookings to the US, which ultimately may have contributed to the positive market outlook and supported jet/kerosene crack spreads. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $15.39/b, up by $2.27 m-o-m and was higher by $10.18 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI extended the upward trend and exhibited the strongest positive performance across the barrel in October, propelled by the lingering effects of sizeable cuts in production levels due to the recent hurricane-related refinery outages, amid the ongoing cut in output levels attributed to major turnarounds, leading to more severe product tightness in the US gasoil segment. Positive global 52 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations economic indicators, as well as stronger gasoil exports to Brazil, resulted in added gasoil market strength. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $11.60/b, up by $4.02 m-o-m and by $8.24 y-o-y. US fuel oil crack spreads against WTI took a downturn in October, pressured by demand-side weakness. Going forward, the end of the autumn peak maintenance season should support fuel oil markets as traders’ efforts to replenish fuel stocks are expected to boost gasoline and diesel yields to the detriment of fuel oil. In October, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus $7.91/b, lower by $3.95 m-o-m, and lower by $7.49 y-o-y. European market Gasoline crack spreads rebounded from the loss Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent registered in the previous month and exhibited gains US$/b albeit limited, as they benefitted from healthy 30 domestic consumption, despite the seasonal weakness. Resilient mobility levels in key European 20 economies provided support for gasoline demand. 10 Furthermore, with regard to European gasoline exports, lower US requirements were offset by strong 0 import requirements from West African countries, which contributed to the slight gains seen in October. -10 The gasoline crack spread against Brent averaged Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 $19.94/b in October, up by 44<U+023C> m-o-m but up by $9.75 y-o-y. Premium gasoline Jet/Kerosene Gasoil Fuel oil 1.0% s Sources: Argus and OPEC. In October, jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent extended the gains seen in the previous month, and soared to their highest since January 2020, backed by continued improvement in air travel, while excess supplies contracted as refiners further cut output of the fuel. Jet fuel markets appear to have finally taken off as more governments ease air travel restrictions. Global jet fuel demand was around 15-20% below 2019 levels, with confidence generated by rising vaccination levels leading to increased passenger flight bookings. Jet fuel/kerosene stocks were reported around 29.2% lower than the same time a year ago. The draw in stocks was encouraged by a backwardation structure in the paper market, which made jet/kerosene less profitable to be kept in storage. The monthly gain in jet/kerosene during October represented the strongest positive performer and the main margin leader across the barrel in Europe. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $12.19/b, up by $3.71 m-o-m and $9.64 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads showed a robust performance in October, as diesel balances in the Atlantic Basin look increasingly tight for winter. Strong support from the freight and agricultural sector amid rising heating oil demand, led to a drop in middle distillate Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage hub inventory levels down to their lowest level since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. European gasoil prices rose to $96.92, the highest level recorded since October 2018. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $13.38/b, which was higher by $3.42 m-o-m and $9.21 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads took a downturn in October, despite robust overall demand, as the barge market was more subdued, pressured by a recent surge in barge freight rates on the Rhine river amid decreasing water levels. The 3.5% fuel oil crack dropped as freight rates increased, with this weakness in the residual market exacerbated by falling seasonal demand from power generation companies in South Asia and the Middle East. The European very low sulphur fuel oil market also saw reduced support in the Mediterranean, while supplies were reported sufficient to meet demand. A pick-up in fuel oil exports to fulfil utility requirements going forward, amid the current high gas price environment should lend support to fuel oil markets in the near term. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus $1.82/b in October, having lost $1.36 m-o-m and $2.39 y-o-y.

Asia naphtha crack spreads continued to trend upwards, as rising driving demand in Asia and strength in naphtha fundamentals helped sustain light ends intakes amid lighter y-o-y naphtha cracker turnaround schedules. Strong exports to Japan, as well as firm steam cracking margins registered in early October provided support. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged $2.99/b, having increased by 41<U+023C> m-o-m, and $1.81 y-o-y. In the middle of the barrel, jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia strengthened, and climbed in October to their highest level since December 2019 as air travel demand continued to recover. The gradual relaxation of travelrelated and border restrictions in Asia Pacific nations, has resulted in a surge in flight bookings. The recovery in aviation fuel demand amid expectations of a near term pick-up in kerosene volumes for heating, has set the stage for a positive outlook for jet/kerosene markets, which until the previous month have been the slowest markets to recover across the barrel on a global scale since 2020. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $11.63/b, up by $4.32 m-o-m and $10.68 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread soared, showing the largest m-o-m gains across the Asian barrel and was supported by continued strength in fundamentals as well as the global contraction in gasoil availability. Strong industrial and manufacturing activities amid a rebound in transportation following the relaxation of pandemic related-restrictions in some nations within the region, proved supportive. At the same time, the ongoing cut in gasoil exports from China to minimize the nationwide energy crises due to the coal and natural gas shortage, has incentivised consumers to resort to India and South Korea to alleviate the shortfall in supplies, which contributed further to the strengthening. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $11.92/b, up by $4.83 m-o-m and $9.19 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spread weakened in response to ample supplies up to mid-October, on the back of high production rates in China, as well as vanishing seasonal demand from Pakistan. Although, towards the end of the month, fuel oil supplies were reported to be on decline. This shrinkage in fuel oil availability, as well as encouraging conversion margins, amid the energy crisis in China and the growing interest in alternative fuels for power generation given the high natural gas price environment, all are expected to provide support in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus $6.65/b, down by $3.26 m-o-m and $4.48 y-o-y. 54 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Table 6 1: Short-term prospects for product markets and refinery operations Time Event Asia Europe US Observations frame Potential Nov 21<U+F0EA> Negative <U+F0EA> Negative <U+F0EA> Negative Concerns over the spread of new reinforcement Dec 21 impact on impact on impact on COVID-19 variants could exert of mobility product product product pressure on fuel consumption restrictions markets markets markets levels and lead to product surplus in the near term.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 57 Tanker Market Tanker Market Dirty tanker spot freight rates continued to show some positive momentum in October, with gains across all classes. Rates benefited from a general pick-up in activity starting at end-September. VLCCs and Suezmax enjoyed the highest rates so far this year, with average gains of 16% and 29% m-o-m respectively, while Aframax rates were up 22% m-o-m. For VLCCs, the Middle East-to-East route averaged WS42, up 17% m-o-m. For Suezmax, the West Africa-to-US Gulf Coast averaged WS65 for a gain of 35%. Meanwhile, clean tanker spot rates also strengthened, as a 22% gain in West of Suez offset a 6% decline in the East. The tanker market is expected to see a continued improving performance through the end of the year as concerns regarding a winter energy crunch in the power sector as well as a pick-up in economic activity supports tonnage demand for crude and products. However, higher bunker costs will limit earnings. Spot fixtures The latest estimates show global spot fixtures declined in October after a strong performance in September. Fixtures averaged 14.54 mb/d, representing a decline of 1.7 mb/d, or 10% m-o-m. Compared to the previous year, spot fixtures were 0.3 mb/d, or around 2%, lower.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 61 Crude and Refined Products Trade Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports in October eased from the high levels seen over the summer to average 6.1 mb/d, while crude exports continue an alternating pattern of rises and dips, this time on the up side with 2.8 mb/d supported by a pickup of flows to Europe. China’s crude imports fell back in September, averaging 10.0 mb/d as independent refiners remained on the sidelines due to a lack of crude import quotas. In India, crude imports hit a five-month high, averaging 4.3 mb/d in September, as refiners boosted runs amid a recovery in economic activity. Japan’s crude imports declined from the previous month’s peak, but still remained at a relatively good level of 2.5 mb/d in September as refiners looked toward preparations for winter. In OECD Europe, the latest data for July shows crude imports remaining strong at around 8.6 mb/d, while crude exports continued to edge higher reaching 0.4 mb/d amid a return of flows to Asia. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports eased from the higher levels seen over the summer, averaging 6.1 mb/d in October. Crude inflows declined 0.3 mb/d or around 4% m-o-m. However, compared with the same month last year, crude imports were 0.8 mb/d, or 15%, higher. Preliminary data for US crude imports by source for October shows strong gains in flows from Canada, which coincided with the 760-tb/d Enbridge Line-3 pipeline replacement coming onstream. Canada’s flows averaged around 0.3 mb/d or 10% higher over the month. In contrast, Mexico’s flows into the US declined 0.1 mb/d or 20%. US crude exports averaged 2.8 mb/d in October, continuing an alternating pattern of rises and dips. This time the uptick was supported by a pickup of flows to Europe. Exports were 0.2 mb/d or 6% higher m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, crude exports were around 0.1 mb/d lower, representing a drop of around 5%.

India was the leading destination with flows of 0.4 mb/d, followed by Canada and South Korea with 0.3 mb/d each. US net crude imports averaged 3.3 mb/d in October, compared with 3.7 mb/d the month before and 2.4 mb/d in the same month last year. On the product side, preliminary data shows US product imports tapered off in October, falling to 2.1 mb/d, as gasoline imports declined with the end of the driving season. This represents a m-o-m drop of 0.4 mb/d or more than 14%. Compared with the same period last year, product imports were broadly unchanged. 62 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Product exports recovered from a storm-impacted five-year low the month before to average around 5.0 mb/d in October. Product outflows were 0.4 mb/d or around 8%, higher m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, product exports were 0.4 mb/d, or 7%, lower. As a result, preliminary data shows US net product exports averaged around 3.0 mb/d in October, compared with 2.2 mb/d in the previous month and 3.4 mb/d in the same month last year. Table 8 1: US crude and product net imports, mb/d Change US Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Oct 21/Sep 21 Crude oil 3.24 3.74 3.30 -0.44 Total products -3.43 -2.21 -2.95 -0.74 Total crude and products -0.19 1.53 0.34 -1.18 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: EIA and OPEC. Preliminary data indicates that the US net crude and product imports averaged 0.3 mb/d in October, as crude imports remained at good levels and as product exports remained soft. This compares with net imports of 1.5 mb/d the month before and net exports of almost 1.0 mb/d in October 2020, which highlights the volatility in the US net liquids figures over the past year. Looking ahead, US crude imports should benefit from seasonal support in the final months of the year, while crude exports are expected to remain at the current stable levels. Product flows should see some seasonal support later in 4Q. China China’s crude imports fell back from the previous month’s surge, averaging 10.0 mb/d in September as independent refiners remained on the sidelines due to a lack of crude import quotas. Compared to the previous month, crude inflows declined 0.5 mb/d or 5%. The September figures were 1.8 mb/d or 15% lower than the inflated levels seen in the same month last year, when importers took advantage of low oil prices to build inventories. Preliminary data for October shows China’s crude imports fell markedly, averaging 8.9 mb/d, the lowest since 2018, as both state-run refiners and independents limited buying amid destocking. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia remained at the top position in September with a share of over 19%. Russia was second with a share of 15% and Iraq was third with over 11%.

Products imports declined by around 8% or 0.1 mb/d to average 1.5 mb/d in September, primarily driven by declines in fuel oil, although volumes for that product were robust y-o-y. Independent refiners have been utilizing fuel oil as a feedstock due to lack of access to crude import quotas, which were only issued midOctober. Product imports were and down 0.2 mb/d or 17% compared to the same month last year. Product exports recovered from a 13-month low the month before to average 0.9 mb/d in September, driven by higher outflows of diesel, prior to concerns about a shortage over winter. Product exports were 0.2 mb/d or 17% lower m-o-m but some 4% higher y-o-y.

Sources: China, Oil and Gas Petrochemicals and OPEC. As a result, China remained a net product importer for the third-consecutive month in September, with net product imports averaging 0.4 mb/d, compared with net imports of 0.7 mb/d the month before and 0.2 mb/d in the same month last year. Given the shift in government policy toward the refining sector, it is likely that China will remain on the net import side, particularly over the winter months. Looking ahead, with the issuance of a final round of crude import quotas, crude imports may lift in the final months of the year. Product exports are expected to decline sharply for all products except jet fuel as the government prioritizes the domestic market. India India’s crude imports hit a five-month high in September, averaging 4.3 mb/d as refiners boosted runs amid a recovery in economic activity. Compared with the previous month, crude imports rose 0.2 mb/d, or around 5%. Imports were also 0.6 mb/d, or 16%, higher than in the same month last year. In terms of crude imports by source, the latest data for August shows Iraq continued at the top position with a share of almost 22%, despite a decline in its share. Saudi Arabia was second with around 16%, followed by the United States with around 14%. The United Arab Emirates was fourth with 10%. For products, imports remained steady above 1 mb/d for the second month in a row, averaging 1.1 mb/d, as a jump in gasoline imports partially offset declines in fuel oil and LPG. Product inflows in September were around 3% or 31 tb/d lower m-o-m but broadly unchanged compared with the same month last year.

Looking ahead, crude imports should see continued gains through the end of the year, as the economic momentums strengthens and refiners continue to boost runs. Rising consumption could keep imports close to current levels and weigh on product exports. However, with Chinese refiners expected to curtail exports of products except for jet fuel, this leaves a hole in regional product supply flows that Indian refiners will no doubt seek to fill. 64 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 Crude and Refined Products Trade Table 8 3: India’s crude and product net imports, mb/d Change India Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Sep 21/Aug 21 Crude oil 3.55 4.11 4.30 0.19 Total products -0.17 -0.10 -0.21 -0.10 Total crude and products 3.37 4.00 4.09 0.09 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – November 2021 65 Crude and Refined Products Trade OECD Europe The most recent available official data show OECD Europe crude imports remained strong in July, averaging 8.5 mb/d. Imports were largely unchanged m-o-m, but were 0.6 mb/d or almost 8% higher than July 2020. In terms of source of imports, Iraq took over the top spot, supplying 964 tb/d to OECD Europe in July, which still represents a decline of 9% m-o-m. The US fell to second place with 941 tb/d, down 17% m-o-m. Libya was third with 813 tb/d, up 13% m-o-m. Crude exports into the region continued to edge higher to mark a three-month high of 0.4 mb/d in July. This represents an increase of 84 tb/d or more than 26%. Compared with the same period last year, crude exports were 43 tb/d, or about 10%, lower. In terms of destinations, China was the top buyer of OECD Europe crude exports outside the region, averaging 248 tb/d in July. This represents an increase of 85% or 114 tb/d. Korea was second with 81 tb/d followed by India with 34 tb/d and Canada with 21 tb/d. Flows to the US declined 57% m-o-m in July to average 19 tb/d. As a result, net crude imports averaged just under 8.2 mb/d in July, marginally lower compared to the month before. In July 2020, net crude imports stood at around 7.5 mb/d.
