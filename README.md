# NLP project (ongoing)
This project aims at implementing n-grams NLP model to generate an OPEC speeches of a given lenght. It is still undercontruction (eg classes are not definied yet). 
<br />
An interesting theoretical explanation of such a model can be find here: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf

# Classes: 
* TxtAnalysis: gathered all functions necessary to pre-process text data 
* NGrams: contains all functions to implement from scratch an n-grams

# Data:
OPEC speeches of 2021 and 2022 from https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/publications/338.htm

# Main code:
Notebook that contains 
* (1) an exploratinon and first cleaning part
* (2) a modelization part (ongoin)

# Main interest:
Based on given inputs (txt files) this code produces a coherent speeches

# Potential improvements: 
* use n-grams model with more depth 
* Create an app to viz results 
* Scrape more speeched 

# To run the code: 
* have python >= 3.9 installed
* pip install -r requirements.txt
