The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) value dropped by $1.74, or 2.1%, in November to average $80.37/b, amid lower prices of almost all medium and heavy sour grades in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The year-to-date (y-t-d) ORB value reached $69.45/b, which is $28.71, or 70.4%, higher compared with the same period last year of $40.75/b. Similarly, crude oil futures prices ended November sharply lower amid higher volatility after a broad selloff in futures and equity markets, amid the emergence of the new Omicron COVID19 variant and easing concerns about an energy crunch. The ICE Brent first-month fell by $2.90, or 3.5%, in November to average $80.85/b, and NYMEX WTI declined by $2.57, or 3.2%, to average $78.65/b. DME Oman crude oil futures prices fell by $2.11 m-om, or 2.6%, to settle at $79.70/b in November. The spread between the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI benchmarks narrowed further in November by 33¢ to average $2.20/b. Hedge funds and other money managers accelerated selling in November, contributing to the decline in oil prices. Combined speculative net length positions linked to ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI dropped to the lowest level since November 2020. The backwardation structure in all three markets weakened considerably in the second half of November. World Economy The global GDP growth forecast in 2021 is revised slightly down to 5.5%, from 5.6% in the previous month’s assessment, while the 2022 growth forecast remains unchanged at 4.2%. The US is still expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022, unchanged from last month’s assessment. Similarly, Euro-zone economic growth remains at 5.1% for 2021 and at 3.9% for 2022. Japan’s economic growth forecast for 2021 is revised down to 2% from 2.5%, after an unexpectedly strong decline in 3Q21, but forecast for 2022 is revised up to 2.2% from 2%, with ongoing 4Q21 momentum expected to be carried over into next year. Given the softening growth momentum in 2H21, China’s economic growth forecast for 2021 is revised down to 8% from 8.3% and to 5.6% from 5.8% for 2022. India’s forecast for 2021 is revised down to now stand at 8.8%, compared with 9% in the previous month, but anticipated momentum from 4Q21 has lifted the 2022 growth forecast to 7%. Russia GDP growth forecast remains unchanged at 4% for 2021 and 2.7% for 2022. Brazil’s economic growth forecasts for both 2021 and 2022 are also unchanged at 4.7% and 2%, respectively. The ongoing robust growth in the world economy continues to be challenged by uncertainties related to the spread of COVID-19 variants and the pace of vaccine rollouts worldwide, as well as ongoing global supply-chain bottlenecks. Additionally, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with rising inflationary pressures and potential central bank responses, remain key factors that require close monitoring. World Oil Demand World oil demand is kept unchanged compared to last month’s assessment, showing a growth of 5.7 mb/d in 2021. However, oil demand was adjusted higher in 1H21, amid better-than-anticipated transportation fuel consumption in OECD, offset by a downwardly-revised estimate for 3Q21 due to increased COVID-19 cases and softer industrial production in China, as well as easing transportation fuel recovery in India. The 4Q21 oil demand was adjusted slightly lower, mainly to account for COVID-19 containment measures in Europe and the potential impact of the new Omicron COVID-19 variant. The forecast for 2022 is also kept unchanged at 4.2 mb/d. Indeed, some of the recovery previously expected in 4Q21 is now shifted to 1Q22, followed by a more steady recovery throughout 2H22. The impact of the new Omicron variant is expected to be mild and short-lived, as the world becomes better equipped to manage COVID-19 and its related challenges. This is in addition to a steady economic outlook in both the advanced and emerging economies. World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 remained unchanged at around 0.7 mb/d y-o-y to average 63.7 mb/d. The upward revisions in the US, and Canada were offset by downward adjustments to Brazil, and Norway. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, Russia, China, US, Norway, Guyana, and Qatar, while output is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Indonesia and Brazil. Similarly, the non-OPEC supply growth forecast for 2022 is also kept unchanged at around 3.0 mb/d, to average 66.7 mb/d. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are expected to be the US and Russia, followed by Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 v Oil Market Highlights Norway and Guyana. OPEC NGLs are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d both in 2021 and 2022 to average 5.1 mb/d and 5.3 mb/d, respectively. In November, OPEC crude oil production increased by 0.29 mb/d m-o-m, to average 27.72 mb/d, according to available secondary sources. Product Markets and Refining Operations Refinery margins in all main trading hubs weakened in November, as the performance of all product across the barrel in all regions lost ground m-o-m with the exception of Naphtha in Asia. This downturn was attributed to a rise in product outputs as refineries ramped-up run rates, following major turnarounds to replenish product inventory levels. In addition, the seasonal demand-side weakness amid renewed lockdown measures as a result of a rise in COVID-19 infection rates further weighed on product markets. Going forward, a potential continuation of a rise in global refinery processing rates will most likely lead to a widening product balance and continued weakness in product markets in the coming month. Moreover, concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant is set to add to the downside and further suppress the robust recovery in jet fuel margins witnessed in the recent months, particularly during the end of the year holiday season. Tanker Market Dirty tanker spot freight rates remained steady in November, as the expected year-end upward momentum had yet to show. For VLCCs, the Middle East-to-East route averaged WS43, up 2% m-o-m. While this represented an improvement over November 2020, it is still well below pre-COVID levels for this time of year. For Suezmax, the West Africa-to-US Gulf Coast averaged WS61 for a decline of 6%. In contrast, clean tanker spot rates strengthened, with gains both east and west of Suez. Optimism for the end of the year has been shaken somewhat by the uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant on economic activities, as well as the persistent imbalance in the tanker market. Crude and Refined Products Trade Preliminary data shows US crude imports in November partly recovered from a dip in the month before to average 6.4 mb/d. US crude exports also rose for the second month to average 2.9 mb/d. China’s crude imports averaged 8.9 mb/d in October, the lowest since February 2018, although preliminary customs data shows a recovery in November with crude imports averaging 10.2 mb/d. India’s crude imports feel back, following 2 months of gains, averaging 4.0 mb/d in October. In contrast, India’s product imports increased, driven by higher inflows of gasoline and fuel oil. Japan’s crude imports fell for the second month in a row, averaging 2.4 mb/d in October. In OECD Europe, the latest data for August shows crude imports remaining strong at 8.7 mb/d, while crude exports continued to edge higher reaching 0.5 mb/d. Commercial Stock Movements Preliminary October data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks up by 9.9 mb m-o-m. At 2,773 mb, they were 357 mb lower than the same time one year ago, 207 mb lower than the latest five-year average and 174 mb below the 2015-2019 average. Within the components, crude and products stocks rose by 9.4 mb and 0.5 mb m-o-m respectively. At 1,307 mb, OECD crude stocks stood 154 mb below the latest five-year average and 149 mb below the 2015-2019 average. At 1,465 mb, OECD product stocks exhibited a deficit of 52 mb below the latest five-year average, and were 25 mb lower than the 2015-2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks rose m-o-m by 1.0 day in October to stand at 61.7 days. This is 12.1 days below October 2020 levels, 2.7 days below the latest five-year average, and 0.7 days less than the 2015-2019 average. Balance of Supply and Demand Demand for OPEC crude in 2021 is revised up by 0.2 mb/d from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 27.8 mb/d, around 4.9 mb/d higher than in 2020. Demand for OPEC crude in 2022 was revised up by 0.2 b/d from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 28.8 mb/d, around 1.0 mb/d higher than in 2021. vi OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 Feature Article Feature Article Review of 2021 and outlook for 2022 The global economy recovered strongly in 2021, supported by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus in major economies, pent-up demand and increased investments. World GDP growth is estimated at 5.5% in 2021 and is forecast at 4.2% in 2022. However, numerous challenges have emerged Graph 1: Real GDP growth for selected countries and during the year, as the recovery was increasingly regions in 2021-2022 (%) divergent among and within major economies. 5.5 World 2021* Moreover, ongoing supply-chain issues, in 4.2 5.0 combination with continued tight labour markets have OECD 3.6 2022* led to rising core-inflation in some major economies.

This could potentially lead to additional India 7.0 challenges for highly indebted emerging economies, 2.9 OPEC 3.0 with foreign currency debt. Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. Global oil demand growth is estimated to have Graph 2: World oil demand and non-OPEC supply rebounded by 5.7 mb/d y-o-y in 2021. The non-OECD growth in 2021-2022 (mb/d) region increased 3.2 mb/d, while the OECD is estimated to have added 2.5 mb/d. This increase is 5.7 2021* 2022* driven by a steady rebound in economic activities and improved transportation fuel consumption, despite a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and containment 4.2 measures. 3.0 In 2022, world oil demand is forecast to increase by 4.2 mb/d, y-o-y, given improved COVID-19 management and rising vaccination rates, enabling economic activity and mobility to return to pre0.7 pandemic levels, supporting transportation fuels in particular. OECD oil demand is forecast to grow by World oil demand Non-OPEC supply 1.8 mb/d in 2022, while the non-OECD region Source: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. is projected to increase by 2.3 mb/d, supported by steady momentum in economic activities, particularly China, India and Other Asia. Meanwhile, as vaccination rates increase, the impact of the Omicron variant is projected to be mild and short-lived. On the supply side, non-OPEC growth in 2021 is estimated at 0.7 mb/d, impacted by major production outages in 2H21, due to weather and accidents, prolonged and unforeseen maintenance, as well as COVID-19-related safety measures in offshore platforms and drilling areas. On the other hand, non-OPEC participants in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) continue to return their planned volumes to the market. The main drivers of growth in 2021 for non-OPEC supply are estimated to have been Canada, Russia, and China. In 2022, non-OPEC supply is projected to see robust growth of 3.0 mb/d, y-o-y, on the back of an expected gradual increase in drilling and completion activities in the US, leading to expected growth of 0.6 mb/d for US tight oil output. The US and Russia are forecast to contribute two thirds of total expected growth, followed by Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, Norway, and Guyana. However, investment in the non-OPEC upstream sector in 2021 and 2022 is estimated at around $350 billion each, showing a 50% drop compared to the 2014 level, and thereby limiting growth potential. While the expected recovery in 2021 was surrounded with challenges, some of these are expected to continue into the next year. The expected market balance continues to be determined by the evolution of the COVID19 pandemic, as a key factor of uncertainty, but the successful joint efforts of the DoC continue to closely monitor all developments in a timely and vigilant manner, to be able to react to rapidly changing market circumstances.

In November, North Sea Dated and WTI's first month declined m-o-m by $2.17 and $2.25, respectively, or 2.6% and 2.8%, to settle at $81.37/b and $79.11/b. WTI's first month fell the least among the benchmarks, declining by $1.17 m-o-m, or 1.4%, to settle at $80.29/b. The ORB value fell by $1.74, or 2.1%, in November to average $80.37/b. After two consecutive months of strong gains, the ORB fell on lower related crude benchmarks and lower official selling prices of almost all medium and heavy sour grades in all three markets – Asia, Europe and the Americas. Y-t-d, the ORB value was $28.71, or 70.4%, higher at $69.45/b, compared to $40.75/b for the same month in 2020. Crude oil futures prices ended November sharply lower after broad sell-offs in futures and equity markets triggered by fears that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant could derail the global economic and oil demand recovery. Market sentiment worsened due to a lack of information about the severity of this new variant. Meanwhile, concerns about an energy crisis and higher oil demand from the gas-to-oil switch eased as gas prices moved lower in major hubs. Oil prices were little changed after the US and other large consumer countries announced the release of crude oil from their strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs). The ICE Brent first month fell by $2.90, or 3.5%, in November to average $80.85/b, and NYMEX WTI declined by $2.57, or 3.2%, to average $78.65/b. DME Oman crude oil futures prices fell in November by $2.11 m-o-m, or 2.6%, to settle at $79.70/b. The spread between the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI benchmarks narrowed further in November by 33¢ to average $2.20/b. The sell-off by hedge funds and other money managers accelerated in November and combined speculative net length positions linked to both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI dropped to their lowest levels since November 2020. The sell-off was more pronounced in NYMEX WTI as speculators were more bullish about the US futures contract. Hedge funds were net sellers of an equivalent of about 176 mb between the week ending 26 October and the week of 30 November, a decline of 29.2%. The backwardation structure in all three markets weakened considerably in the second half of November, suggesting that the prospect of a global supply-demand balance in the short-term is swinging from expectations of tightness to over-supply. The value of light sweet crude strengthened further in November against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in Asia and the USGC, extending the previous month's trend. However, in Europe, the value of Urals firmed against the North Sea Dated in November supported by strong demand from Europe and prospect for lower supply of the grade in December. Crude spot prices Crude oil spot prices averaged lower in November, Graph 1 1: Crude oil price movement on fears of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 as well US$/b as a surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe and other 90 regions.

OPEC Basket North Sea Dated WTI Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 1 Crude Oil Price Movements However, in the first half of the month, the physical crude market showed solid supply/demand fundamentals, which was reflected in healthy refining margins, strong backwardation in all markets, and higher crude oil differentials for all grade qualities. Official data showed higher refinery runs in November m-o-m in Europe, China and the US. Furthermore, refiners raised buying interest in December loading, specifically from AsiaPacific refiners, on expectations of higher crude runs in November and December and solid refining margins for light and middle distillates. However, refining margins weakened in the second half of November, including in the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

West African, Mediterranean and Caspian crude oil differentials continued to strengthen in November on firm European refining margins and solid buying interest, which resulted in lower availability of unsold cargoes for December loadings. Strong light distillate margins that benefited from the healthy petrochemical sector added support to light sweet crudes. However, weakening refining margins in the second half of November and wide Brent-Dubai Exchange of Futures for Swaps (EFS) that make west-to-east arbitrage less favourable limited crude differentials gains. Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe crude differentials rose in November to North Sea Dated, increasing by a monthly average of 30¢, 61¢, and 83¢, respectively, to stand at premiums of 39¢/b, 88¢/b and 88¢/b. Saharan Blend crude differentials also averaged higher, rising by 62¢/b m-o-m to stand at a premium of 87¢/b on average. The Caspian CPC Blend differential rose firmly m-o-m, increasing by 71¢, to an average of 31¢/b discount to North Sea Dated. However, the crude differential of medium-heavy sweet Cabinda weakened m-o-m by 10¢ in November to settle at a premium of 43¢/b, amid soft demand for the grade from China. In Northwest Europe, the North Sea crude differentials rose on strong demand from European refiners and flow to Asia, although gains were curbed by high crude flow from the US to Europe of similar crude quality, limited arbitrage opportunity and the availability of offshore floating barrels. The Forties and Ekofisk crude differentials rose by 45¢ and 61¢, respectively, on a monthly average in November to settle at a premium of 65¢/b and 88¢/b. 2 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 Crude Oil Price Movements In the Middle East, crude differentials to Dubai mostly rose on strong demand from Asia-Pacific refiners and healthy margins. The value of the Oman crude differential rose by $1.05 m-o-m in November to a premium of $3.35/b. In the USGC, however, coastal crude differentials of Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Mars to WTI weakened m-o-m in November on high WTI futures prices, strong WTI market structure in the first half of the month, and tight Brent-WTI spread, which make these crudes less competitive compared to foreign crudes, specifically in Asia. The oil supply recovery in the Gulf of Mexico and the announcement of the SPR release also added downward pressure on crude differentials. LLS and Mars crude differentials fell by 58¢ and 76¢, respectively, on a monthly average, to a premium of 28¢/b and a discount of $3.39/b. OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) The ORB value fell by $1.74, or 2.1% in November to average at $80.37/b. After two consecutive months of strong gains, the ORB fell on lower related crude benchmarks and lower official selling prices of almost all medium and heavy sour grades in all three markets – Asia, Europe and the Americas. Y-t-d, the ORB value was $28.71, or 70.4%, higher at $69.45/b, compared to $40.75/b for the same month in 2020. All ORB component values weakened in November, with West and North African Basket components – Bonny Light, Djeno, Es Sider, Girassol, Rabi Light, Sahara Blend and Zafiro – falling $1.91, or 2.3% m-o-m on average, to $80.34/b. The multiple regions’ destination grades – Arab Light, Basrah Light, Iran Heavy and Kuwait Export – declined by $1.77, or 2.1% m-o-m on average, to settle at $80.52/b. Murban crude fell by 67¢, or 0.8% m-o-m on average, to settle at $82.06/b. Merey component also fell by $1.51, or 2.4% m-o-m on average, to settle at 61.21/b. The oil futures market Crude oil futures prices ended November sharply lower after broad sell-offs in futures and equity markets triggered by fears that the rapid spread of the new Omicron variant could derail the global economic and oil demand recovery. Market sentiment worsened due to a lack of information about the severity of this new variant, while news reports amplified concerns that the Omicron variant could be potentially more transmissible and more resistant to the available vaccines. ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI ended November about 16.7% and 21.3% lower, respectively, compared to early November levels, to reach their lowest since August 2021 on daily basis. The sharp decline in oil prices mirrors a sudden change in sentiment from October's bullish market when oil futures prices hit their highest since 2014. The drop in oil futures prices in the fourth week of November occurred in a market already under pressure since early in the month. Crude oil futures prices started to retreat in the first half of November from multi-year highs amid easing concerns about an energy crisis and higher oil demand from the gas-to-oil switch as gas prices moved lower in major hubs. The return of lockdowns in Central Europe and Russia due to rising COVID-19 cases earlier in November and in the UK in October, when case numbers reached their highest level since July 2021, raised further concerns about near-term oil demand and weighed on oil prices. Investors were also eyeing a new wave of COVID-19 infections in many areas, including Europe and China, which impacted mobility indexes. Furthermore, the projections of higher global oil supply in December and the EIA weekly data showing a rise in US crude oil stocks for three consecutive weeks to 5 November, the highest level since August 2021, also contributed to easing worries about tightening the global oil market. Data showed China’s manufacturing PMI was lower in October, indicating further economic contraction. Meanwhile, investors were worried that the US Federal Reserve would accelerate plans to boost interest rates to manage inflation, which weighed on market sentiment and prompt some traders to take profits from long positions. Oil prices resumed their downward trend in the third week of November amid rising volatility as perceptions shifted from a tight oil market in the short term to a risk of an oversupplied market. Market sentiment deteriorated on concerns about the global oil demand outlooks due to the surge of COVID-19 cases in Europe and other regions, and the US dollar jumped against a basket of other major currencies to its highest level since July 2020. Worries about the oil demand outlook intensified further after Austria imposed a national lockdown, while other countries tightened COVID-19-related measures to curb rising infections. Meanwhile, investors weighed the impact of a potential release of crude oil from SPRs in major consuming countries, while the IEA in its November monthly report forecast a 1.5 mb/d increase in global oil supply in November and December. Furthermore, the OPEC Secretariat, IEA and other major agencies projected global oil supply exceeding global oil demand in 1Q22. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 3 Crude Oil Price Movements Earlier in the fourth week of November, oil prices were little changed after the US and other large consumer countries announced crude oil releases from their SPRs. But the news about the Omicron variant later in the week pushed oil prices sharply lower on worries that further mobility restrictions and lockdowns could dampen oil demand. Table 1 2: Crude oil futures, US$/b Change Year-to-date Crude oil futures Oct 21 Nov 21 Nov/Oct % 2020 2021 NYMEX WTI 81.22 78.65 -2.57 -3.2 38.61 67.76 ICE Brent 83.75 80.85 -2.90 -3.5 42.56 70.57 DME Oman 81.81 79.70 -2.11 -2.6 42.35 69.12 Spread ICE Brent-NYMEX WTI 2.53 2.20 -0.33 -13.0 3.95 2.81 Note: Totals may not add up due to independent rounding. Sources: CME, DME, ICE and OPEC. The ICE Brent first-month fell by $2.90, or 3.5%, in November to average $80.85/b, and NYMEX WTI declined by $2.57, or 3.2%, to average $78.65/b. Y-t-d, ICE Brent was $28.01, or 65.8%, higher at $70.57/b, while NYMEX WTI was higher by $29.15, or 75.5%, at $67.76/b, compared to the same period a year earlier. DME Oman crude oil futures prices fell in November by $2.11 m-o-m, or 2.6%, to settle at $79.70/b. Y-t-d, DME Oman was higher by $26.77, or 63.2%, at $69.12/b. On 10 December, ICE Brent stood at $75.15/b and NYMEX WTI at $71.67/b. The spread between the ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI benchmarks narrowed further in November by 33¢ to average $2.20/b as the NYMEX WTI price declined less than ICE Brent on a monthly average. The Brent-WTI futures spread narrowed in the first half of November to just above $1/b on average as NYMEX WTI was more supported by low crude stock levels in the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub, which fell to their lowest level since September 2018 in the week to 5 November. The gradual rise in US refinery net input of crude oil in November m-o-m added support to WTI futures prices. Furthermore, investors were more bullish on NYMEX WTI contracts compared to ICE Brent, which was reflected in a higher long/short positions ratio. However, The Brent-WTI futures spread widened in the fourth week of November to above $4/b as NYMEX WTI came under pressure after the US announced the release of 50 mb from its SPR and the sell-off on 26 November was more in NYMEX WTI as speculators were more bullish compared to ICE Brent. However, the North Sea Dated premium to WTI Houston widened in November by 37¢ m-o-m, to average $1.81/b. Higher US crude oil exports in November, which according to the EIA weekly data averaged about 3 mb/b, and declining crude oil stocks at US PADD3 gave some support to the crude value in the USGC. The sell-off by hedge funds and other money managers accelerated in November, and combined speculative net length positions linked to both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI dropped to their lowest levels since November 2020. The sell-off was more pronounced in NYMEX WTI as speculators were more bullish about the US futures contract. Net long positions rose sharply by the end of October and the long/short ratio reached 14:1 in the week to 9 November. Rising concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant and a sharp decline in oil prices prompted speculators to heavily liquidate their long positions.

Hedge funds were net sellers of about 176 mb between the week ending 26 October and the week of 30 November, a decline of 29.2%. Money managers cut their combined futures and options net long positions in ICE Brent by 92,360 contracts, or 35.6%, to reach 167,166 lots between the week of 26 October and the week of 30 November, according to the ICE Exchange. During the same period, gross long positions fell by 80,726 lots, or 23.8%, to 259,068 contracts, while gross short positions rose by 11,634 lots, or 14.5%, to 91,902 contracts. Hedge funds and other money managers in November also cut their net long positions related to NYMEX WTI by 83,213 lots, or 24.4%, to stand at 257,631 lots in the week of 30 November. This was due to a rise in short positions by 21,828 lots, or 70.3%, to 52,891 contracts, and a decline of 61,385 lots, or 16.5%, in long positions to 310,522 contracts, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The long-to-short ratio of speculative positions in the ICE Brent contract continued to fall in November, decreasing from about 4:1 in late October to about 3:1 in the week of 30 November. Similarly, the NYMEX WTI long-to-short ratio declined to about 6:1 in the week to 30 November, compared to 12:1 in late October. Total futures and options open interest volumes on the two exchanges fell in November, declining by 6.4%, or 376,996 contracts, to stand at 5.5 million contracts in the week ending 30 November. The futures market structure The backwardation structure in all three markets weakened considerably in the second half of November, suggesting that supply/demand expectations are shifting from a tight market to over-supply. This is mainly driven by surging COVID-19 cases in Europe and other areas; the fast spread of the Omicron variant in several countries, which darkened the outlook for global oil demand; and softening expectations of higher oil demand from the gas-to-oil switch. From the supply side, global oil supplies are expected to increase in December from OPEC and non-OPEC producers and SPR releases in several major oil-consuming countries. Despite the sharp decline in oil prices, the ICE Brent M1-M3 spread widened in November by 27¢ on a monthly average to a backwardation of $1.87/b as the front-month contract in the first three weeks of November was supported by positive market sentiment related to the strong oil demand outlook towards the end of the year. The healthy physical crude market and the reduction of crude oil availability in the Atlantic Basin amid a steady recovery in oil refinery buying interest contributed to strengthening the backwardation market structure. However, the ICE Brent forward curve flattened sharply in the fourth week of November and all the curves fell, including those at the middle and the back end, mirroring a shift in market sentiment and forecast of a surplus in the global supply-demand balance. ICE Brent’s M1-M6 backwardation was little changed in November, narrowing by 2¢ on monthly average to settle at $3.92/b on average, compared to a backwardation of $3.94/b in October.

Sources: CME and OPEC. Sources: DME and OPEC. The DME Oman market also strengthened in the first three weeks of November on robust crude demand from Asian refiners, amid higher refinery operations in several large oil-consuming countries and strong refinery margins. The rise of Brent-Dubai EFS to above $5/b made Dubai crude more attractive to Asian buyers than OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 5 Crude Oil Price Movements Brent-related crude in the Atlantic Basin. On a monthly average, the DME Oman M1-M3 backwardation widened by 50¢ m-o-m in November, to $2.25/b on average, from a backwardation of $1.75/b in October. In the US, crude oil stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub fell to their lowest level since October 2018 in the week to 5 November. This, coupled with higher crude demand from US refiners, has largely contributed to the steepening WTI future backwardation structure, with the NYMEX WTI M1-M3 rising to above $3/b in early November. However, the WTI forward curve flattened significantly in the fourth week of November on the sharp decline in front-month prices due to the worsening oil demand outlook, and as the crude stocks at Cushing started to increase in the second half of November, easing worries about a tighter oil market in PADD2 and a further decline of crude stocks at Cushing. The North Sea Brent M1/M3 spread widened to a backwardation of $2.05/b in November on a monthly average, compared to a backwardation of $1.34/b in October, widening by 71¢. In the US, the WTI M1/M3 spread also widened by 14¢ to a backwardation of $1.80/b on monthly average in November, from a backwardation of $1.66/b in October. However, the Dubai M1/M3 monthly average spread widened the most by $1.15 to a backwardation of $3.33/b on average in November, from a backwardation of $2.18¢/b in October. Crude spreads The value of light sweet crude strengthened further in November against the value of medium and heavy sour crude in Asia and the USGC, extending the previous month's trend. Higher refining margins of light and middle distillate products in the first half of November compared to low margins of sour products, specifically high sulphur fuel oil, contributed to the widening of the sweet-sour spread. Meanwhile, high costs of desulphurization due to high gas prices also weighed on the value of medium and heavy sour crude. However, in Europe, the value of Urals firmed against the North Sea Dated in November supported by strong demand from Europe and prospect for lower supply of the grade in December. In Europe, although North Sea crude differentials of Graph 1 7: Differential in Asia, Europe and USGC light sweet crudes rose in November, the Urals US$/b medium-sour crude discount to North Sea Dated 10 decreased again last month by 32¢ on average 8 m-o-m, to average $1.29/b, compared to $1.61/b in 6 October. The Urals grade was supported by firm 4 demand from European refiners for late November and 2 early December cargoes, a lower m-o-m export 0 programme for the grades in December, supportive -2 refining margins, and slow sour crude flow from the east. The Urals crude oil differential to Dated also rose Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 Dec 21 in Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean by 58¢ and 32¢ on average m-o-m, respectively, to stand at a Tapis-Dubai North Sea Dated-Urals discount of $1.48//b and $1.29/b. LLS-Mars Sources: Argus, OPEC and Platts. In the USGC, the sweet-sour crude differential widened in November with the LLS premium over medium-sour Mars rising on a monthly average by 21¢ to $3.69/b. The value of Mars sour crude came under further pressure from soft demand from refiners in the USGC due to maintenance and the prospect of higher sour crude supplies from the US SPR and the recovery of crude production in the GoM, which is mainly sour crude. A wider spread between light distillate and heavy distillate margins in the USGC, specifically HSFO, also contributed to widening the LLS-Mars crude differential in November. In Asia, the sweet-sour crude differential also widened in November with the Tapis premium over Dubai increasing on a monthly average, despite a strong sour crude market in the Middle East amid high demand from Asia-Pacific refiners. The Tapis-Dubai spread widened by 21¢ in November to reach $5.07/b, as domestic light sweet crudes were supported by lower competition from similar crude quality in the Atlantic Basin amid a wide Brent-Dubai EFS that rose to $5.42/b in early November, its highest since September 2013. On a monthly average, the Brent-Dubai EFS rose in November by 32¢ to $4.58/b. Strong gasoline and naphtha margins in the first half of November and strong demand for petrochemical feedstock supported light sweet’s value and contributed to widening the Tapis-Dubai spread. 6 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 Commodity Markets Commodity Markets Energy commodity prices weakened in November led by a large drop in coal prices. This development came on the back of receding concerns of supply shortages after a ramp up in China’s coal production following government instructions to ensure adequate supplies for winter. Natural gas prices receded in Europe on expectations of additional imports from Russia and lower coal prices, while in the US the expectation of warmer than average December weather resulted in a sharp drop that extended into the first week of the month. Base metals declined, led by a large retreat in aluminium prices on the expectation for a recovery in metals output as energy restrictions in China were relaxed, but low inventories did provide some support. Gold prices advanced, following declines in real interest rates over the month. Trends in selected commodity markets The energy price index declined m-o-m by 6.4% in November, following two months of gains, with all components declining across regions. The average index level was up by 82.5% in the January–November 2021 timeframe, compared with the same period in 2020. The non-energy index declined m-o-m by 0.2%, with the base metals index dropping by 3.7% and the agricultural index rising by 1.3%. The non-energy index was up by 33.6% in the January–November window, compared to the same period of 2020.

Sources: World Bank and OPEC. The Henry Hub natural gas price dropped m-o-m by around 8.4% to average $5.0/mmbtu. Prices fell as mild weather resulted in injections to storage extending into mid-November, while prices of European and Asian benchmarks also retreated from panic levels. Temperature forecasts for the month of December increasingly trended toward warmer than average conditions, resulting in a sharp drop in prices during the last couple of weeks of the month, to levels below $4/mmbtu. According to the EIA, utilities withdrew 59 bcf to working gas underground storage during the week ending 26 November 2021. This build left total working gas in underground storage at 3,564 bcf, around 2.4% below the latest five-year average. At the end of October stocks were 2.7% below the five-year average. Natural gas prices in Europe declined from the record reached the previous month. The average Title Transfer Facility price was down m-o-m by around 11% to $27.6/mmbtu. Average prices in the January– November period were around four times higher than the same period last year. Prices dropped on the expectation of higher Russian supplies, however, colder than average temperatures, in view of seasonally low inventories, supported prices. Furthermore, carbon emission prices increased – which supported coal to gas switching – on the back of a proposal by the new German coalition government to set a floor price of €60/mt, with the purpose of bringing forward the exit from coal in power generation to 2030, vs. a previous target of 2038. At the same time, some unexpected outages at major facilities also supported liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in Asia. Inventory levels in Europe declined amid the arrival of the seasonal colder weather, and ended November around 68% full. This is around 20% below the average of the previous five years, vs. 77% full at the end of October, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. Last year, inventories were around 88% full at the end of October. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 7 Commodity Markets Australian thermal coal prices declined m-o-m by almost 30% in November to average $157.5/mt. In the January–November timeframe, prices were 130% higher compared to the same period last year. Prices dropped sharply due to the ramp up of China’s coal production, following the directive from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to ensure adequate winter supplies. This was mentioned in the previous MOMR. According to the Global Times, citing NDRC information, output has stabilized around 12 million tonnes per day since mid November – close to the historic high, and inventories at power plants had increased by around 90% since the end of September. At the same time, the forecast of warmer than average weather in North East Asia at the beginning of December, also weighed on prices. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China’s thermal power output rose by 5.2% y-o-y in October, compared to an increase of 5.7% y-o-y in September. At the same time, coal output rose by 4.0% y-o-y, vs. a drop of 0.9% y-o-y in September. Hydropower fell by 11.9% y-o-y in October vs. a 0.3% decline y-o-y in September. According to the latest customs data, coal imports increased by 30% m-o-m in November to 35.05 million tonnes. This is up by 10.6% in 2021.

Aluminium (RHS) Haver Analytics and OPEC. Sources: LME, Thomson Reuters and OPEC. The base metal price index declined m-o-m by 3.7% in November, with mixed movement across group components. Aluminium fell by 10%, following nine consecutive monthly increases, to average 2,636.5/mt. This was on the expectation that power-rationing measures will be gradually lifted with the increased availability of coal at power plants, mentioned earlier. However, falling warehouse stocks at the London Metal Exchange (LME) provided support. Average prices in the January–November period were 46.2% higher than for the same months of 2020. Average monthly copper prices dropped m-o-m by 1% in November to average $ 9,728.9/mt. Average prices in the January–November period were 54.2% higher than for the same months of 2020. Prices dropped following some financial market weakness and the rising dollar value, but the physical market remained supportive. Stock levels at the LME declined by 45% to 76,450 tonnes at the end of November, as expected the previous month. Meanwhile, estimations from the International Copper Study Group (ICGS) for the refined copper balance (adjusted for unreported Chinese inventories) in the January-August period showed a deficit of 120,000 tonnes, vs. a market deficit of 95,000 tonnes in the January-July estimation the previous month. This also supported the view of a tightening balance. Iron ore prices dropped by 21.7% m-o-m to $96.2/mt, close to May 2020 levels. Average prices in the January–November window were 58.4% higher than the average for the same period last year. As reported in previous reports, steel making in China is still restricted due to power rationing measures, despite some recent alleviation in this regard. Steel making activity in China dropped by 23.3% y-o-y in October, and was mainly responsible for a y-o-y drop in global steel output of 10.6% during the month, according to the World Steel Association, In the group of precious metals, gold prices advanced, as expectations for real interest rates in the US declined over the month. Gold prices were up by 2.2% in the January-November period, when compared with the similar period of 2020. Silver and platinum prices rose by 3.3% and 2.1% m-o-m, respectively in November. 8 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 Commodity Markets Investment flows into commodities Money managers’ net length positions increased in gold, but declined in crude oil, copper, and natural gas.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 9 World Economy World Economy Diverging growth trends continue among the various economies and regions. Strong momentum in the commodities sector, which supported growth particularly in 2H21, led to upward revisions in Latin America excluding Brazil, as well as in OPEC and other developing economies. However, the 2H21 soft patch in Asia, impacted by COVID-19-related constraints and corresponding supply-chain issues, led to 2021 downward revisions in Japan, China and India, leading to a lower 2021 global GDP growth forecast of 5.5% compared with 5.6% in the previous month. The global GDP growth forecast for 2022 remains unchanged at 4.2%. US growth remains unchanged at 5.5% in 2021 and at 4.1% in 2022. Euro-zone economic growth remains unchanged as well at 5.1% for 2021 and at 3.9% for 2022. Japan’s economic growth forecast for 2021 is revised down to 2% from 2.5%, after an unexpectedly sharp GDP decline in 3Q21. Japan’s forecast for 2022 was revised up to 2.2% from 2%, assuming that ongoing 4Q21 momentum carries over into the next year. Given the softening growth momentum in 2H21, China’s economic growth forecast was revised down to 8% from 8.3% for 2021 and to 5.6% from 5.8% for 2022. India’s economic growth forecast for 2021 was revised down as well, to 8.8%, compared to 9% in the previous month, while anticipated 4Q21 growth and consequent spill-overs have lifted the 2022 growth forecast to 7%. Russia’s GDP growth forecast remains unchanged at 4% for 2021 and at 2.7% for 2022. Brazil’s economic growth forecast is also unchanged for both 2021 and 2022 at 4.7% and 2%, respectively. Robust growth in the world economy continues to be challenged by uncertainties related to the spread of COVID-19 variants and the pace of vaccine rollouts worldwide, as well as ongoing global supply-chain bottlenecks. Additionally, sovereign debt levels in many regions, together with rising inflationary pressures and potential central bank responses, remain key factors requiring close monitoring.

However, recent re-emerging challenges stemming from COVID-19-related issues, the spread of the Omicron variant and weakening Asian growth momentum have highlighted the risks despite the great success of domestic stimulus in key economies and multilateral cooperation to support the global economy. The sharp reaction of markets to the emergence of the Omicron variant has highlighted the fragility of the global growth momentum, which could still be very much impacted by unforeseen COVID-19-related developments. Moreover, supply chain disruptions and labour market tightness will improve only gradually despite recent positive developments. Inflationary pressures are another important issue, primarily in the US and the Eurozone given the importance to the US dollar and the Euro. In Brazil and Russia, rising inflation recently led their central banks to hike interest rates significantly, likely impacting the progress of their recoveries in 2022. While India has also experienced rising inflation in 2021, price rises have retracted to more reasonable levels in recent months, in line with the central bank’s expectations, allowing it to not hike interest rates. Numerous factors point to the possibility that the current rise in inflation may normalise next year, but given that salaries and wages have already risen in the US and the Euro-zone this trend is expected to continue. Hence, inflation should see an upward level shift when compared to pre-pandemic levels. 10 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Economy Global trade has been impacted by ongoing supply Graph 3 1: Global trade chain disruptions, but has continued to support the % change y-o-y global economic recovery amid strong demand.

Near-term global expectations The global economy is forecast to continue its recovery into 2022 with the return of normalised quarterly growth after high growth rates in 2021, which were driven by base effects and supported by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, two factors that will not be present to the same extent in 2022. Moreover, growth is forecast to remain regionally divergent in the coming year. The US is expected to perform well and to remain supported by domestic consumption and fiscal stimulus. The Euro-zone will again be impacted by social distancing measures in 1Q22, but is then forecast to recover again for the remainder of the year. The European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to continue its accommodative monetary policies longer than the US Federal Reserve, which is expected to taper its monetary stimulus at a relatively more pronounced pace. Japan is expected to benefit from the ongoing 4Q21 domestic recovery with a spillover into 2022 in combination with the recently announced fiscal stimulus measures, as well as the continuation of loose monetary policy and the rebound in global trade. However, growth levels in Japan will be lower than in the OECD group on average. In the emerging economies, India is forecast to benefit from a recovery in domestic demand and its exportoriented services sector. The continued rebound of growth in India is in contrast to China’s momentum that is forecast to remain impacted by challenges in the real-estate sector, among other issues, that the economy will need to handle in the coming year. Furthermore, both Brazil and Russia will experience relatively low growth rates when compared to their emerging market peers. The strong rise in key interest rates in both Brazil and in Russia will impact domestic growth in 2022. Positively, Russia is forecast to continue benefitting from OPEC and non-OPEC efforts to stabilize the oil market. Importantly, the underlying assumptions for world economic growth in 2021 and 2022 are so far largely unchanged. These include, in particular, the assumption that COVID-19 remains contained in the advanced economies in the sense that it will not dampen the recovery beyond current 4Q21 levels – especially in OECD Europe – and that the pandemic will not pose a significant obstacle to major emerging economies. In addition, labour market tightness is expected to improve gradually, a factor that otherwise may lead to rising inflation at the global level as well. While it currently seems that economic growth risks are tilted towards the downside, upside potential could also materialize. Stimulus measures in the US could turn out to be more effective, while a continued strong recovery in the Euro-zone and a solid rebound in Japan could lead to stronger-thanexpected growth in these OECD economies. Moreover, China may overcome the soft patch in the 2H21 recovery through governmental support and ongoing export-driven momentum. India may also see an acceleration in domestic demand and a strengthening rebound in the export-driven services sector. With these base assumptions, 1Q21 global GDP growth is estimated to stand at 0.6% q-o-q and at 1.4% q-o-q in 2Q21. A deceleration is seen in 3Q21 GDP growth at 0.9% q-o-q, while 4Q21 growth is forecast to decelerate further to 0.5% q-o-q. The growth pattern in 2022 is forecast to be spread relatively equally and in line with average historical patterns.

COVID-19-related challenges will not derail the recovery. Moreover, it is assumed that inflation will not continue at the high 2H21 levels, particularly in the US and the Euro-zone. OECD OECD Americas US Update on the latest developments After lacklustre 3Q21 GDP growth amid supply chain bottlenecks and COVID-19 related developments, 4Q21 output has so far been encouraging. 3Q21 GDP growth was confirmed to have slowed down, standing at only 2.1% q-o-q on seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), after 6.7% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In the meantime, the latest business sentiment measures and other leading indicators are pointing to a rebound in the current quarter. And while the labour market remains tight, this also could be taken more as a signal of the strengthening economy rather than as a sign of weakening. Also, consumer confidence has held up well, and while the US Federal Reserve is likely to continue its monetary tightening, the various asset classes, including equity markets and house prices, have remained at high levels, supporting ongoing consumption. Central bank policies are pointing to continued tapering of the current monthly $120 billion quantitative easing measures after the US Federal Reserve announced a monthly $15 billion tapering for at least November and December. Additional fiscal stimulus measures and the apparent overcoming of budget issues in Congress should support solid growth in the near term. However, the overarching topic remains the new Omicron COVID-19 variant and how it might impact growth in the near term. Thus far, mobility continues to see a positive growth trend across the US. Consumer confidence held up well in November. The index provided by the Conference Board showed an index level of 109.5 in November, after 111.6 for October and compared with 109.8 in September. US inflation continued rising at 6.2% in October, after 5.4% y-o-y in September. The strongest appreciation came once again from the sub-sector of transportation, pointing to the possibility of a transitory effect after the reopening of the economy. Prices in the transportation sector rose by 18.7% y-o-y in October, compared with 16.5% y-o-y in September and after 17.6% y-o-y in August. Excluding the volatile components of energy and food, inflation stood at 4.6% y-o-y in October, compared with 4% y-o-y in September and August. 12 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Economy The unemployment rate fell again to stand at only Graph 3 3: US monthly labour market 4.2% in November, compared with 4.6% in October % % and 4.8% in September.

Near-term expectations Near-term expectations are expected to be well supported, while numerous uncertainties need close monitoring, including near-term inflation, labour market tightness and the corresponding development of labour compensation, the consequent response of the Fed’s monetary policy and certainly the near-term development of COVID-19 and the possibility of further restrictions that may impact mobility and hence consumption. Positively, the current quarter’s growth levels are forecast to increase with support from solid consumer confidence and the need to replenish inventories. The draw-down from inventories was significant towards the end of 2H21, and inventories will likely be replenished in 2H21. Supply chains, however, will need to be monitored as an ongoing shortage of vital input goods like semiconductors could dampen this expectation. Another aspect that will play an important role in the near-term recovery is the labour market trend as it remains to be seen if job seekers will re-enter the job market. The latest job additions and rising participation rate point to a gradual improvement in the labour market. Additional fiscal stimulus may provide further upside to the growth forecast. In terms of quarterly growth developments, 1Q21 GDP growth stood at 6.3% q-o-q SAAR, and 2Q21 growth was reported at 6.7% q-o-q SAAR, while 3Q21 slowed down to 2.1% q-o-q SAAR, based on BEA numbers. With expectations for inventory restocking in 4Q21, ongoing fiscal stimulus measures and a rebound in consumer confidence, growth levels for 4Q21 and 2022 are forecast to remain sound. Growth in 4Q21 is expected to reach 4.8% q-o-q SAAR, a slight uptick from last month’s forecast, when the 4Q21 growth forecast stood at 4.6% q-o-q SAAR. Quarterly growth in 2022 is forecast to be relatively equally distributed at slightly above 4% for the first three quarters of the year, before slowing down to around 2.5% q-o-q SAAR in 4Q22. The November PMI levels as provided by the Institute Graph 3 4: US-ISM manufacturing and for Supply Management (ISM) point to an ongoing non-manufacturing indices recovery.

Hence, growth in 2022 remains unchanged at 4.1%. Major uncertainties, mainly associated with the pandemic, but also supply chain issues, inflation and consequent monetary policy adjustments, remain. OECD Europe Euro-zone Update on the latest developments The Euro-zone’s growth momentum has continued to some extent in 4Q21 and the most recent rise in services sector business sentiment indicates there is even the possibility of a surprise to the upside. Additionally, consumer confidence holds up well despite retracting slightly, all pointing at a solid base in domestic consumption. However, the most recent lockdown measures in Austria and other European economies have impacted mobility and lowered growth on a quarterly level. The combination of fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policy has continued supporting consumption and investment. The global trade recovery has been another supportive factor, especially for major exporters, such as Germany, France and Italy. Inflation rose further in November, continuing the rising trend in October and September. Despite this trend, the European Central Bank (ECB) currently appears to be willing to continue monetary stimulus. It is clear that inflationary developments have been further accentuated by global supply issues that have led to price rises for input goods, which has especially impacted the manufacturing sector. Inflation in the Euro-zone rose to 4.8% y-o-y in November, compared with 4.1% y-o-y in October, and after having reached 3.5% y-o-y in September. When excluding volatile items such as food and energy, inflation stood at 2.4% y-o-y in November, compared with 2.2% y-o-y in October and 2% in September. Positively, supported by the monetary easing of the ECB, lending to the private sector by financial institutions continued expanding again in October, rising by 2.8% y-o-y after an increase of 2.6% y-o-y in September and 2.5% y-o-y in August. The labour market continued to see improvements. According to the latest numbers from Eurostat, the unemployment rate stood at 7.3% in October, after 7.4% in September and 7.5% in August. Retail sales in value terms have risen on a yearly Graph 3 5: Euro-zone retail sales base with growth of 4.2% y-o-y in October, following % change y-o-y 5%, y-o-y in September and 3.4% y-o-y expansion in 30 August, all on a seasonally adjusted basis.

However, the services sector PMI was contradicting the perception of a strong slow-down in the current quarter and there is some possibility that growth will surprise to the upside as it was the case for growth levels in 2Q21 and 3Q21. However, for the time being a significantly softer dynamic is expected to continue into 1Q22. With regard to the pandemic, it remains to be seen whether vaccination rates will achieve sufficient levels in the rest of the winter to prevent further lockdown measures in 1Q22. There are still numerous economies that have a vaccination at around 70%. Ongoing fiscal stimulus and the continued accommodative ECB monetary policies are forecast to counterbalance some of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 situation in 4Q21 and 1Q22. The underlying assumptions for the rest of the year and 2022 have not changed. It is anticipated that COVID-19 containment efforts in 4Q21 and beyond will be effective enough to support the recovery and not derail the economy. Moreover, supply chain issues are expected to be temporary in nature and not negatively impact growth. Importantly, no major lockdown measures are forecast in the Euro-zone for 1Q22. After reported growth of -0.8% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q21 and 9.1% q-o-q SAAR in 2Q21 and 3Q21, 4Q21 growth is forecast at 2.4% q-o-q SAAR. The November PMI for the Euro-zone economy Graph 3 6: Euro-zone PMIs pointed to an ongoing recovery in manufacturing and Index services sectors. The PMI for services, the largest 70 sector in the Euro-zone, rose to 55.9, compared with 54.5 in October and 56.4 in September. The 58.4 60 manufacturing PMI rose slightly as well slightly to stand at to 58.4, compared with 58.3 in October and 55.9 58.6 in September. 50 40 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit and Haver Analytics.

OECD Asia Pacific Japan Update on latest developments The Japanese economy experienced a very weak 3Q21 GDP growth, weaker than expected, given COVID19 restrictions lowering domestic consumption. 3Q21 GDP was reported to have declined by 3.6% q-o-q SAAR. While government stimulus continued in 3Q21, with government expenditures growing by 4.1% q-o-q SAAR, private consumption declined by 5.1% q-o-q SAAR. As Japan has entered 4Q21 in a very improved situation with vaccination rates now around 80%, consumer confidence has strongly increased and leading OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 15 World Economy business sentiment indicators are pointing to a considerable improvement in 4Q21. Considering the ongoing recovery in the US, exports should also be well supported in the current quarter. In addition, ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus is forecast to support the recovery in 4Q21. The government approved a draft for a supplementary 2021/2022 budget of 31.6 trillion yen. This corresponds to around 6% of GDP. However, when reviewing the details, the economic impact will likely be more modest. One natural limitation is the Japanese’s economy ability to grow much beyond its potential output level due to capacity constraints in the labour market, but also in capacity utilisation in industrial facilities. Operating rates in manufacturing utilisation are certainly seeing upside from the current low base in 3Q21, standing at a level of 90.2 index points. This compares to more than 100 before the pandemic. But despite the large stimulus and the approximately 10 percentage point upside in this measure, it remains to be seen how quickly higher utilisation can be reached given the ongoing supply chain constraints and it also shows that even with a 10% upside from the 3Q21 level, GDP growth may not be able to move significantly beyond the pre-pandemic growth potential of around 2%. Industrial production (IP) declined in October on a yearly basis, even as it compares to an already large decline in the previous year. The drop in October stood at 3.1% y-o-y, compared with a decline of 2.4% y-o-y in September. Positively, on a monthly basis, IP rose by 1.1% m-o-m in October, after a decline of 5.8% y-o-y in September. Impacted by the strong declines in IP, exports in Graph 3 7: Japan’s exports October retracted considerably. It shows a yearly % change y-o-y growth level of 9.4% after rising by 13% y-o-y in 60 September and 26.2% y-o-y in August, all on a non-seasonally adjusted basis.

As these measures were lifted and the vaccination rates in Japan have reached almost 80% the recovery in retail trade is forecast to continue in 4Q21. On a positive note, consumer confidence points to a 4Q21 recovery. The consumer confidence index level, as reported by the Cabinet Office, rose to 39.3 in November, compared with 39.2 in October and 37.9 in September. This points to a continued rebound in domestic consumption, which is likely to be supported by further stimulus measures. Near-term expectations Growth is forecast to rebound considerably in 4Q21, after the weakness in 3Q21. With rising vaccination rates and generally low infection levels, and with the economy to be supported by further stimulus measures, the near term forecast appears to be well supported. However, the trend will evidently depend on supply-chain developments and COVID-19-related issues. By taking into consideration the reported decline in 3Q21 GDP growth, the GDP growth forecast for 2021 was lowered considerably. As reported by Japan’s statistical office, 1Q21 GDP declined by 2.9% q-o-q SAAR. Despite the lockdown measures in 2Q21, growth was reported to have recovered and reached 2% q-o-q SAAR. As reported, quarterly growth in 3Q21 declined significantly, falling by 3.6% q-o-q SAAR. Supported by the high vaccination rates, fiscal stimulus and the ongoing recovery in global trade, 4Q21 is forecast to rebound significantly, reaching 8.5% q-o-q SAAR. In 2022, 1Q22 GDP growth is forecast to stand at 1.8% q-o-q SAAR and to move towards 1% q-o-q SAAR towards 4Q22. 16 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Economy The gradual rebound in the economy’s services sector Graph 3 8: Japan’s PMIs is also reflected in the November PMI, which stands Index above the growth indicating 50-level for the second 55 54.5 consecutive month. The PMI for the service sector, 53.0 which constitutes around two-thirds of the Japanese 50 economy, rose significantly to 53, compared with 50.7 in October and 47.8 in September. The manufacturing PMI rose to stand at 54.5, after a level of 53.2 in 45 October and 51.5 in September. 40 Nov 20 Dec 20 Jan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 Services Manufacturing Sources: IHS Markit, Nikkei and Haver Analytics.

Hence, GDP growth was revised up for 2022 to stand at 2.2%, compared with 2% in the previous month. However, COVID-19 related developments, and most recently the Omicron variant pose downside risk to the expected recovery. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments China’s economic recovery momentum remained weak in November despite the ease in electricity shortages and as supply-side pressures and the new wave of infections might linger and dampen the recovery in household consumption. Industrial production grew marginally to 3.5% y-o-y in October, but the real estate crisis might dampen industrial production and fixed investment given the strong backward linkages to industrial output. In October, leading nominal fixed asset investment contracted by 2.9% y-o-y while housing sales declined 24.1% y-o-y with no signs of easing regulations on property developers. Yet the government might take some measures following the policy trend to boost coal production and lower coal prices.

October. In November 2021, producer price inflation eased to 12.9% y-o-y reflecting the government's efforts to control surging commodity prices and an easing power crunch. Meanwhile, China's 2021 consumer price inflation accelerated to 2.3% y-o-y from 1.5 % y-o-y a month earlier. Near-term expectations The slowdown in the economic recovery continued amid the lingering effects of ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks combined with supply chain disruptions that could continue in the near term. The easing of electricity shortages might help disruptions in manufacturing output, but government-housing control policies are weighing on property investment, and this might lead to a further slowdown. Yet this makes more room for additional policy support as policymakers need to maintain balance and shore up short-term growth. This might include securing liquidity in the interbank market, boosting infrastructure development and easing some credit and real estate regulations. However, policymakers may face a critical challenge in finding the right balance between controlling the latest COVID-19 outbreaks and maintaining normal economic activities. The economic slowdown has closely mirrored recent Graph 3 10: China’s PMI PMI indices, which have also slowed down.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 21 World Economy Africa South Africa Update on the latest developments The South African economy expanded by 2.9% y-o-y in 3Q21, after a revised record growth of 19.1% y-o-y in 2Q21. This growth points to the second economic expansion after four quarters of contraction due to the pandemic crisis. Yet the country’s economic recovery might be at risk by the new COVID-19 variant. External demand continued to support the economic recovery, yet the trade surplus narrowed to ZAR22.2 billion in September from a revised ZAR42.3 billion in August. Exports dropped 1% to ZAR157 billion. Imports, on the other hand, increased 15.9% to ZAR134.8 billion. The annual inflation rate in South Africa stood at 5% in October of 2021, unchanged from November; however, it remained above the 4.5% midpoint of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range of 3-6% for six consecutive months. In line with the elevated inflation, the South African Reserve Bank raised its benchmark repo rate by 25 bps to 3.75% for the first time in three years. The Committee believes a gradual rise in the repo rate will be sufficient to keep inflation expectations well anchored and moderate the future path of interest rates. The CPI forecast has been revised slightly higher to 4.5% in 2021 (from 4.4% in September), 4.3% in 2022 (vs 4.2%) and 4.6% in 2023 (vs 4.5%). Meanwhile, official GDP growth projections were lowered to 5.2% in 2021 from 5.3% but kept unchanged at 1.7% in 2022 and 1.8% in 2023. Near-term expectations In the near term, the outlook for South Africa’s economy is skewed more to the down side, challenged by the Omicron COVID-19 variant and vaccination developments. Moreover, recent political instability, along with headwinds in main trading partner China, could have a significant impact on the economy in 2H21. In the meantime, the seasonally-adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 57.2 in November 2021 from 53.6 in the previous month, marking an expansion in South Africa's manufacturing activity, the strongest since June.

Indeed the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels, but uncertainties related to current increased restrictions in Europe besides the global supply chain disruptions and a slow rate of vaccination might hinder this progress. More importantly, the latest inflation data may indicate another downside recovery risk, as it may lead to secondary effects, especially in the coming year, such as a lowering of individual savings and exports.

Nigeria The near term outlook of Nigeria economy is hindered by the elevated inflationary and labour market pressures. The improvement in oil prices still supported the economic recovery. The inflation rate has eased to 15.99% in October 2021, from 16.63% in September marking the lowest rate since last December, largely due to a sustained moderation in food prices. On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased by 0.98%, following a 1.15% rise in the previous month. The Stanbic IBTC Bank Nigeria PMI reflected a solid expansion in business conditions despite the ongoing overall prices increase as it rose to a four-month high of 55 in November of 2021, up from 54.1 in October. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) The United Arab Emirates’ PMI edged up to 55.9 in November 2021 from 55.7 in October mirroring improvement in non-oil private sector activities. This was the highest reading since June 2019, amid rising output and new orders rising fuelled by the increased economic activity driven by Expo 2020. Overall, the business sentiment was weakened by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 but was still steady and the economic outlook is more positive supported by oil prices and government support policies.

Oil demand was adjusted higher in 1H21 amid better-than-anticipated transportation fuel consumption in the OECD and downwardly revised in 3Q21 due to an increase in COVID-19 cases, softer industrial production in China and a slower transportation fuel recovery in India. Additionally, 4Q21 oil demand was adjusted slightly lower mainly to account for COVID-19 containment measures in Europe and their potential impact on transportation fuel demand, as well as the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant (Omicron). Total world oil demand is anticipated to reach 96.5 mb/d on an annualized basis in 2021. In 2022, world oil demand growth was also kept unchanged at 4.2 mb/d and total global consumption at 100.6 mb/d. Some of the recovery previously expected in 4Q21 has been shifted to 1Q22, followed by a more steady recovery throughout 2H22. Moreover, the impact of the new Omicron variant is projected to be mild and short-lived, as the world becomes better equipped to manage COVID-19 and its related challenges. This is in addition to a steady economic outlook in both the advanced and emerging economies, despite current inflation and supply chain bottlenecks, ongoing trade issues and their impact on industrial and transportation fuel requirements. In terms of fuels, global gasoline demand is projected to continue to recover and surpass pre-pandemic levels. Light distillates and diesel are expected to gain support from recent capacity additions and healthy end-user demand, increases in infrastructure spending and improvements in overall industrial activity.

The latest available US monthly demand data for September implies a strong increase of approximately 1.8 mb/d y-o-y, making up 99% of losses incurred during September 2020 and lower than September 2019 by a mere 0.02 mb/d. LPG, gasoline, jet kerosene and diesel requirements contributed to the bulk of the increases, with LPG and gasoline gaining in September 2021 by 0.4 mb/d each y-o-y, while jet kerosene increased by 0.6 mb/d and diesel 0.3 mb/d, y-o-y. The demand for gasoline, jet kerosene and diesel fell in September 2020 by 0.7 mb/d, 0.8 mb/d and 0.1 mb/d y-o-y respectively. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHA), vehicle miles of travel in the US increased by 7.7% y-o-y in September this year after rising by 8.5% y-o-y in August. In September 2020, the indicator fell by 10.4% y-o-y. Light vehicle retail sales, as reported by Autodata and Haver Analytics, were at 12.4 million units according to seasonally adjusted annual rates (SAAR), compared with 13.2 million units in August; in September 2020 total sales were 16.5 million units and 17.2 million units were sold in September 2019. Industrial production was higher by 4.6% y-o-y in September 2021 after increasing by 5.6% y-o-y in the previous month. Preliminary figures for October based on weekly 26 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Oil Demand data indicate a continuation of a recovery in transportation fuel performance, with both gasoline and jet kerosene demand increasing by almost 1.6 mb/d y-o-y in total.

Near-term expectations Despite recent increases in COVID-19 cases in the US and the emergence of the Omicron variant, the overall picture calls for optimism for short-term future demand in the region. The current forecast assumes that the effects of the variant on oil demand will be short-lived and not significant, as previous pandemic management experience will control potential impacts and minimize government restrictions. The economy is expected remain strong despite challenges in supply chains and rising inflation. In 2022, OECD Americas oil demand will be supported by solid economic growth and is expected to rise by around 1.1 mb/d y-o-y with the US oil demand accounting for 0.9 mb/d y-o-y. As is the case for 4Q21, any negative impact from the Omicron variant and the pandemic is expected to be small and limited during the first three to four months of the year. The petrochemical and transportation sectors will be the drivers of oil demand in 2022. Gasoline demand will be backed by increases in vehicle sales and strong economic growth. Several expansions in the petrochemical industry will support demand for light distillates in 2022. Downside risks relate to a lesser degree to the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary and supply challenges. OECD Europe Update on the latest developments Oil demand in OECD Europe rose by 0.9 mb/d Graph 4 2: OECD Europe’s oil demand, y-o-y y-o-y in September, driven by a steady recovery in change transportation fuel consumption, following higher mb/d growth in August of 1.3 mb/d y-o-y.

Driving in Italy recoded the highest gains at 28% above pre-pandemic levels, while the mobility index in Spain and Germany was respectively 22% and 18% higher before the pandemic. Gasoline grew by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y compared to similar growth levels in August, and the product is trending higher above September 2019 by around 0.1 mb/d. Petrochemical feedstock demand, led by naphtha, recorded healthy gains in September of nearly 0.2 mb/d y-o-y after rising by 0.1 y-o-y in August. Indeed, naphtha has benefited from high LPG prices and healthy petrochemical margins and consumption of the product is now above September 2019 by around 0.25 mb/d. Petrochemical demand is supported by stable plastics requirements in the health sector, packaging, construction and end-user demand. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 27 World Oil Demand October initial oil demand data suggests a softening momentum in oil requirements in the big four consuming countries, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Demand is assumed to have increased by only 0.2 mb/d y-o-y in October compared to an increase of round 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in September. Data indicates positive developments in Germany, Italy and the UK.

Near-term expectations Looking ahead, concerns about the recent resurgence in COVID-19 in many countries in the region could pose downward pressure on oil demand during the months of December and January. Transportation fuel demand, which softens during the winter, is expected to ease further due to measures to contain the virus. Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and others have announced measures projected to slow the oil demand recovery in the region during the coming months. Oil demand has been adjusted lower in 4Q21 and 1Q22 as a result. Uncertainties around the new Omicron variant and indeed the depth and the magnitude of the current wave will remain high and tilted to the downside as the region enters the winter season. That said, 2022 projections account for a steady rebound in OECD Europe macroeconomic indexes, including industrial production, and the return of some levels of normality towards 2H22. As a result, oil demand is anticipated to rise in 2022 supported by transportation and by industrial fuels. OECD Asia Pacific Update on the latest developments Naphtha staged a strong rebound in Japan and South Graph 4 3: OECD Asia Pacific oil demand, y-o-y Korea, supporting solid gains in Asia-Pacific oil change demand in September. Oil demand rose by more mb/d than 0.6 mb/d y-o-y after posting an increase of 0.5 0.3 mb/d in August. Despite this solid y-o-y rise in 0.2 September, demand remained lower than September 0.2 2019 due to lagging transportation fuel recovery and 0.0 jet fuel in particular. Looking at the product mix, demand was supported by -0.5 naphtha, which rose by more than 0.3 mb/d y-o-y, as naphtha became the feedstock of choice for stem cracker operators in light of high LPG prices. Healthy -1.0 -0.8 petrochemical margins supported by steady end-user 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year demand has also given steam cracker operators incentives to maximize utilization rates and consume 2020 2021* 2022* additional naphtha volumes. Note: * 2021-2022 = Forecast. Source: OPEC. LPG demand marginally increased in September due to the preference to consume naphtha in the petrochemical sector. Naphtha and LPG rose strongly above pre-pandemic levels by nearly 0.3 mb/d compared to September 2019. For transportation fuels, gasoline consumption declined marginally while jet fuel was higher by nearly 0.1 mb/d y-o-y. Gasoline is pressured by increased efficiency in new vehicles, particularly in Japan, where total demand 28 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Oil Demand for gasoline dropped from around 1.0 mb/d in 2010 to around 0.7 mb/d in 2021. On the other hand, demand for jet fuel increased in September backed by a continued recovery in the aviation sector. Preliminary data from by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) indicates a y-o-y increase of around 0.1 mb/d in October, mainly driven by strong petrochemical feedstock demand.

Sources: JODI, METI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Containment measures in Japan, South Korea and Australia seemed to have curbed further increases in COVID-19 cases. As a result, demand for industrial fuels and petrochemical feedstock is expected to gain momentum in the coming months. In addition, Japan’s announcement that it would provide subsidies for gasoline, jet/kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil as an emergency mitigation measure is anticipated to provide a cushion to oil demand over the winter. Overall oil demand is projected to rebound in the region on the back of the economic recovery. Petrochemical feedstock consumption is assumed to be the main contributor to oil demand growth going forward, while jet/kerosene demand is projected to continue to lag 2019 as international business and leisure travel remain under pressure. Non-OECD China Update on the latest developments Continued healthy petrochemical feedstock demand and rebounding mobility supported a strong rise in China’s oil demand in October. Demand increased by more than 0.7 mb/d y-o-y in October compared to and mere 0.1 mb/d y-o-y in September. Demand exceed October 2019 by almost 0.8 mb/d, driven by strong naphtha and LPG needs. In October, naphtha’s economic advantage over LPG favoured its use in steam cracking. LPG prices compared to naphtha remained elevated in recent months, encouraging higher demand for naphtha in China and across many countries globally. Naphtha demand rose by nearly 0.3 mb/d y-o-y in October following a 0.3 mb/d y-oy increase in September. Solid consumption over the past few months raised naphtha demand above prepandemic levels by around 0.6 mb/d compared to October 2019. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 29 World Oil Demand Despite challenging competition from naphtha, Graph 4 4: China’s oil demand, y-o-y change demand for LPG also increased albeit at a slower mb/d pace than naphtha.

Near-term expectations Recent macroeconomic indicators, especially the industrial production index, showed trends that are pressuring industrial fuel demand and especially diesel and fuel oil. These indicators, coupled with the emergence of the Omicron variant, will pose some downside risks to oil demand going into 2022. On the other hand, the winter Olympic Games, scheduled to take place in Beijing in February 2022, and the uptick in transportation fuel demand during the Chinese New Year should provide support to oil demand going into the new year. Petrochemical feedstock, especially naphtha, is assumed to be supported by strong enduser demand and by capacity additions in recent years. Jet fuel is expected to recover more slowly next year and will not reach 2019 levels due to international travel restrictions. India Update on the latest developments Indian oil demand inched up by a marginal 0.04 mb/d y-o-y in October compared to a rise of more than 0.2 mb/d in September. However, in comparison with October 2019, pre-pandemic oil demand showed an increase of around 0.2 mb/d driven by strong household LPG consumption and rebounding mobility and gasoline demand. In September, transportation fuels, gasoline and jet fuel, grew by a combined 0.1 mb/d y-o-y, supported by gradually improving mobility indexes. Google Maps and the Apple mobility index showed a continuation of the mobility recovery from May’s low of 52%. In October, the index hovered around 131% 30 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Oil Demand after registering 122% in September, using January 2020 as a reference point. A pickup in domestic flights also supported the improvement in jet fuel demand. Jet fuel demand was nearly 0.1 mb/d lower than Graph 4 5: India’s oil demand, y-o-y change October 2019 and jet fuel was the only product below mb/d pre-pandemic levels, affected by a slower recovery in 1.0 international flights in the transportation sector and substitution by LPG for cooking fuel in the residential 0.5 0.4 0.4 sector.

Near-term expectations Oil demand in India is on track to record respectable gains in 2021, making up more than 80% of the demand lost in 2020. This steady growth is assumed to continue for the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. Over the short term, demand is assumed to be supported by steady macroeconomic indicators despite retail price challenges. The government’s announcement that it would reduce excise taxes on gasoline and diesel should bring relief to consumers and support demand going forward. For 2022, due to the encouraging economic outlook and the improvement in demand for transportation and industrial fuels, total oil demand is projected to exceed 2019 by around 0.3 mb/d on average for the year. The 2022 oil demand outlook for India takes into account the positive economic outlook supported by stimulus packages as well as better management of COVID-19. The outlook will of course remain subject to uncertainty related to COVID-19 developments, particularly in relation to the emergence of new variants such as Omicron, economic challenges and unusual weather conditions. Latin America Update on the latest developments Supported by a healthy gasoline and diesel rebound, Latin America’s oil demand showed positive y-o-y increases in September.

Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand expectations remain as highlighted in last month’s MOMR and show continued recovery from the historical decline in 2020 for most fuels, led by diesel. Demand is assumed to benefit from shortages in hydropower generation due to drought conditions, thus lending support to fuel oil. Assuming that COVID-19 will have limited impact on the economic recovery, a steady return of mobility to pre-pandemic levels and with stimulus packages providing additional support to the economy, oil demand is projected to increase for the rest of 2021 and into 2022. Brazil is assumed to lead oil demand growth in the coming months, led by transportation fuel followed by industrial fuels, namely diesel and fuel oil. Uncertainties are currently balanced as COVID-19 appears to be contained to a certain extent. On the other hand, economic hardships including unemployment and currency challenges may weigh on oil demand projections going forward. Middle East Update on the latest developments Middle Eastern oil demand rose by a strong 0.5 mb/d y-o-y in September following an increase of around 0.4 y-o-y in August. Unlike India and Latin America, where oil demand exceeded pre-pandemic levels, oil demand in the Middle East fell by more than 0.1 mb/d compared to September 2019, led by lagging jet fuel and fuel oil demand. Mobility supported y-o-y increases in gasoline consumption during September as the mobility index reached 104% when compared to January 2020, according to Google Maps and the Apple mobility index. The index was at 96% of pre-pandemic levels in May 2021. 32 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Oil Demand Gasoline demand increased by more than 0.2 mb/d Graph 4 7: Middle East’s oil demand, y-o-y change after rising by a similar level in August. The significant mb/d reduction in the baseline of comparison contributed to 1.0 this y-o-y rise. Gasoline rose the most in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

In Saudi Arabia, oil demand data for October show a decline despite a y-o-y rise in some products such as diesel and jet fuel. Fuel oil and crude oil for power generation have dropped by more than 0.1 mb/d y-o-y collectively, mainly due to seasonal factors. Conversely, diesel grew by around 0.1 mb/d, supported by a pickup in industrial activities while jet fuel posted some gains supported by increases in domestic and international flights. Demand declined by around 0.1 mb/d y-o-y after posting steady gains in September. Demand remained sharply lower than October 2019 by nearly 0.3 mb/d.

Sources: JODI and OPEC. Near-term expectations Going forward, oil demand in the Middle East is projected to continue to recover in the final months of 2021. Steady economic developments should support industrial fuel demand in the coming months. Additionally, the easing of COVID-19 measures in the region’s main consuming countries should provide strong upside potential for transportation fuels going forward. Jet fuel should gain support from the resumption of international flights in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, the main travel hubs in the region. However, jet fuel demand is not anticipated to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2022 amid lagging intercontinental business travel. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 33 World Oil Supply World Oil Supply Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2021 (including processing gains of 0.13 mb/d) is kept unchanged at around 0.7 mb/d y-o-y, to average of 63.7 mb/d. Some upward revisions to the US and Canada were offset by downward revisions in the supply forecasts of other countries such as Brazil and Norway due to unexpected lower output in 4Q21. Following an upward adjustment in 4Q21, due to a faster-than-expected production recovery in the GoM and steady monthly growth in the main shale plays, particularly in the Permian, the US liquids supply growth forecast was revised up to stand at 0.05 mb/d y-o-y. Canadian liquids production in October hit a new record at 5.8 mb/d, boosted by oil sands producers in Alberta and pipeline capacity expansion. The 2021 oil supply forecast primarily sees growth in Canada, Russia, China, US, Norway, Guyana and Qatar, while output is projected to decline in the UK, Colombia, Indonesia and Brazil. Non-OPEC supply growth for 2022 also remains broadly unchanged at 3.0 mb/d y-o-y, to average 66.7 mb/d. Upward revisions to the supply forecast of the US were offset by downward revisions in the UK, Brazil, Colombia and Latin America others. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are expected to be the US (1.03 mb/d) and Russia (0.98 mb/d), followed by Brazil, Canada, Norway, Kazakhstan and Guyana. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 was revised down by 15 tb/d due to lowerthan-expected output in 2H21 to now stand at growth of 0.1 mb/d y-o-y for an average of 5.2 mb/d. Growth of 0.1 mb/d y-o-y is forecast in 2022 for an average of 5.3 mb/d. OPEC-13 crude oil production in October increased by 0.29 mb/d m-o-m to average 27.72 mb/d, according to secondary sources. Preliminary non-OPEC liquids production in November, including OPEC NGLs, is estimated to have grown by 0.6 mb/d m-o-m to average 70.6 mb/d, up by 3.0 mb/d y-o-y. As a result, preliminary data indicates that global oil supply in November has grown by 0.88 mb/d m-o-m to average 98.28 mb/d, up by 5.62 mb/d y-o-y. Non-OPEC liquids production growth in 2021 was Graph 5 1: Major revisions to annual supply change broadly unchanged from the previous month’s forecast in 2021*, December MOMR/November MOMR assessment to average 0.68 mb/d. In the OECD, upward revisions by 75 tb/d in 3Q21, US 86 and at the same time upward revisions by 277 tb/d in 4Q21, led to an upward revision of 89 tb/d for the year. The main drivers for this revision were the US and Canada 24 Canada with 86 tb/d and 24 tb/d, respectively. These revisions were offset by a few downward Norway -25 revisions, mainly in Norway, by 25 tb/d. However, the non-OECD supply forecast for 2021 Brazil -73 was revised down by 72 tb/d, mainly due to downward tb/d revisions in Brazil and Latin America others by 73 tb/d and 12 tb/d, respectively. -100 -50 0 50 100 Note: * 2021 = Forecast.

US 87 The revisions mainly came from the US, as next year’s forecast was adjusted up based on revisions made in Argentina 17 4Q21. Hence, US liquids supply for 2022 was revised up by 87 tb/d to stand at 1.03 mb/d y-o-y due to the Cameroon 12 re-assessment of tight crude and NGL output. Moreover, the liquids supply forecasts of Argentina Colombia -21 and Cameroon were also revised up.

US liquids production in 2022, excluding processing gains, is anticipated to grow by 1.03 mb/d y-o-y to average 18.69 mb/d, revised up by 0.09 mb/d. The 2022 gains are due primarily to forecast tight crude production growth of 0.6 mb/d and projected growth of 0.18 mb/d in the GoM. However, the expected growth from shale and tight formations as well as from the GoM will be partially offset by natural declines in onshore conventional fields by 0.13 mb/d y-o-y. Given the current pace of drilling and well completion in oil fields, production of crude oil is forecast to grow by 0.65 mb/d y-o-y to average 11.78 mb/d and to finish 2022 at 12.3 mb/d.

Production of NGLs and condensates declined by a minor 7 tb/d m-o-m to average 0.25 mb/d. The higher oil output in October was due to first oil from Aurfugl Phase 2 by operator Aker BP as well as rising production in Martin Linge, which started-up in July. Part of this monthly increase is also due to the return of some fields from seasonal maintenance. Moreover, after years of delays, the Yme field in the southeastern part of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea started production on 25 October. At its peak, the field should deliver around 56 tboe/d. For 2021, Norway’s liquids supply growth forecast has Graph 5 19: Norway’s monthly liquids production been revised down by 25 tb/d m-o-m due to lowerdevelopment than-expected output in 4Q21 by 100 tb/d.

Latin America Brazil Brazil’s crude output in October fell by 0.22 mb/d m-o-m to average 2.78 mb/d, mainly due to maintenance in the P-76 FPSO in Buzios field. In October, total liquids production was pegged at 3.48 mb/d, including NGLs that were down by 6 tb/d to average 80 tb/d, and biofuels which were flat at 623 tb/d. Average crude production in Brazil during January-October 2021, despite the production ramp-up in the Sepia and Buzios fields, declined by 0.06 mb/d, compared with the same period in 2020. This is far from the initial expected growth for 2021. Maintenance has impacted crude production in 2021, and this is expected to continue until the end of the year. Moreover, COVID-19-related health and safety measures at production platforms, delays in project start-ups and heavy natural declines at offshore mature fields, particularly in the Campos Basin, have also contributed to under-performance in production. 44 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 World Oil Supply Hence, the initial liquids supply forecast for 2021 has been revised down m-o-m to now stand at a decline of 0.03 mb/d y-o-y to average 3.64 m/d, including non-crude, mainly biofuels.

This downturn was attributed to a rise in product outputs as refineries ramped up run rates following major turnarounds to replenish product inventory levels. The seasonal demand-side weakness amid renewed lockdown measures as a result of a rise in COVID-19 infection rates further weighed on product markets. Going forward, the potential continuation of a rise in global refinery processing rates will most likely lead to a widening of the product balance and continued weakness in product markets in the coming month. Moreover, concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are set to add to the downside and further supress the robust recovery in jet fuel margins witnessed in the recent months, particularly during the year-end holiday season. Refinery margins US Gulf Coast (USGC) refining margins reversed their Graph 6 1: Refining margins upward trend witnessed since June and stepped US$/b down from the one-year record high reached in the 20 previous month. The return of refineries from major turnarounds led to a rise in product output and 15 provided relief to the severe product tightness 10 witnessed in the recent months. In addition, weakness attributed to seasonality further weighed on US 5 refining economics as product inventory levels started to recover.

A decline in feedstock prices over the month amid the WTI (US Gulf) Brent (Rotterdam) weakness in the product market allowed product Oman (Singapore) prices to retreat from the record high levels of the Sources: Argus and OPEC. previous month. Although the Thanksgiving holiday season lent support to US gasoline markets on a weekly basis, this upside was insufficient to counterbalance the negative impact brought by the surge in product supplies and seasonality. USGC margins against WTI averaged $14.19/b in November, down by $2.70 m-o-m but up by $7.34/b y-o-y. Refining margins in Europe trended downward in response to a rise in refinery processing rates and consequently a widening product balance. In addition, renewed lockdowns in some European countries in light of a hike in COVID-19 infection rates further supressed fuel consumption and ultimately adversely impacted European product markets. Similar to what was witnessed in the USGC, the downturn in European refining economics was derived from all across the barrel. However, the largest contributors to the poor performance came from the jet fuel and fuel oil segments. Jet fuel margins stepped down from their robust performance of recent months backed by a positive recovery in demand for the same product. However, the growing fuel availability as well as reimposed air travel restrictions have overturned the upward trend. European refinery run rates in November increased by 240 tb/d m-o-m, according to preliminary data, as the peak maintenance season in the region ended. In the near term, offline capacity is expected to lose further ground in line with historical trends, which should provide added supply-side pressure to European product markets in the coming month. Refinery margins for Brent in Europe averaged $5.21/b in November, down by 69¢ compared with a month earlier but was up by $4.16 y-o-y. In Asia, margins weakened, affected by a contraction in product margins all across the barrel with the exception of naphtha as the overall estimated rise in Asian product output was 520 tb/d higher relative to the previous month. Moreover, mobility indicators in India eased during November and likely contributed to the weakness. China's daily crude oil throughput was reported to have rebounded in October from its lowest level in more than a year, as refiners there were prompted to ramp up operations in response to the energy crisis amid high fuel prices and strong demand. On the other hand, renewed lockdowns in China added demand-side pressure to the fuel market. Refinery margins for Oman in Asia lost $2.41 m-o-m to average $3.93/b in November, which was higher by $2.90 y-o-y. OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 49 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Refinery operations US refinery utilization rates increased in November to Graph 6 2: Refinery utilization rates average 88.7%, which corresponds to a throughput of % 16.08 mb/d.

On a weekly basis, mobility activity data showed an improvement in domestic vehicle miles travelled over the Thanksgiving holidays, according to external sources. However, this temporary support proved insufficient to overturn the overall supplyand demand-side pressure witnessed throughout the month. The USGC gasoline crack spreads lost $4.12 m-o-m to average $21.04/b in November, but were up by $12.21 y-o-y. USGC jet/kerosene crack spreads reversed course and declined in November following four months of consecutive gains, as jet fuel production rates increased m-o-m. Although jet/kerosene fuel inventory levels continued to decline in November, it was the supply-side upturn that had a stronger impact on the market performance of the same product. The robust improvement in jet fuel markets in the most recent months appeared to come to a halt in November, with concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant, and stricter international air travel measures posing a threat to jet fuel crack spreads in the near term. The US jet/kerosene crack spread against WTI averaged $12.75/b, down by $2.65 m-o-m but higher by $6.22 y-o-y. US gasoil crack spreads against WTI lost ground and exhibited the strongest negative performance across the barrel in November, affected by a rise in refinery output despite healthy demand. In addition, requirements for heating oil in the US remained subdued due to mild temperatures. Despite the overall poor performance, positive global economic indicators, as well as firm gasoil exports to South America, continued to offer limited support to the gasoil market and likely limited further losses. The US gasoil crack spread against WTI averaged $6.53/b, down by $5.08 m-o-m but up by $2.01 y-o-y. 50 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 Product Markets and Refinery Operations US fuel oil 3.5%s crack spreads against WTI declined further in November, pressured by demand-side weakness. Going forward, the end of the autumn peak maintenance season should support fuel oil markets as traders’ efforts to replenish product stocks are expected to boost gasoline and diesel yields to the detriment of fuel oil. In November, the US fuel oil crack spread against WTI averaged minus-$8.73/b, lower by 83¢ m-o-m, and lower as well by $8.47 y-o-y. European market Gasoline crack spreads reversed course again and Graph 6 4: Rotterdam crack spreads vs. Brent declined as domestic consumption weakened. The reUS$/b implementation of lockdowns and mobility restrictions 30 in Europe in response to a hike in COVID-19 infection rates had a negative impact on mobility levels in key 20 European countries and ultimately weighed on 10 gasoline margins.

In November, jet/kerosene crack spreads against Brent showed the second largest loss compared to all other key products across the barrel in Europe, following 3.5% s fuel oil. Jet fuel inventory levels remained relatively low, and jet/kerosene imports from Asia were reported lower. However, weaker market sentiment due to a recovery in refinery output amid tighter air travel restrictions linked to an increase in COVID-19 infection rates exerted pressure on European jet/kerosene margins. The Rotterdam jet/kerosene crack spread against Brent averaged $9.05/b, down by $3.14 m-o-m but up by $5.52 y-o-y. Gasoil crack spreads performed poorly in November as diesel balances in the Atlantic Basin started to widen. Strong support from the freight and agricultural sectors amid rising heating oil demand continued to provide limited support. European gasoil prices fell by $4.09 from the highest level recorded since October 2018 in the previous month, to average $92.83/b in November. The gasoil crack spread against Brent averaged $10.62/b, which was lower by $2.76 m-o-m but up by $5.71 y-o-y. At the bottom of the barrel, fuel oil 1.0% crack spreads continued to weaken, affected by stronger fuel oil availability as well as ample volume arrivals to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage hub from Russia. Meanwhile, gas-to-liquids switching in European power sector was insignificant due to logistical and technical constraints and thus failed to provide any support to European fuel oil markets. In Europe, fuel oil cracks averaged minus-$4.56/b in November, having lost $2.74 m-o-m and $6.48 y-o-y. Asian market The Asian gasoline 92 crack spread weakened on Graph 6 5: Singapore crack spreads vs. Dubai rising gasoline availability despite firm regional US$/b demand, particularly in India. The strong gasoline 20 price environment incentivized Asian refiners to 15 increase gasoline yields which, leading to strong 10 exports from Japan, India and South Korea. 5 Moreover, Chinese refiners were also reported to 0 have ramped up processing rates under government -5 directives to address the energy crisis in the country -10 -15 experienced in the previous month.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 51 Product Markets and Refinery Operations Asian naphtha crack spreads represented the sole positive performer across the barrel in November, likely supported by firm demand from the petrochemical sector and relatively high liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. The Singapore naphtha crack spread against Oman averaged $3.92/b, having increased by 93<U+023C> m-o-m, and $6.54 y-o-y. In the middle of the barrel, jet/kerosene crack spreads in Asia lost ground despite an uptick in Japan of kerosene consumption for heating in the second half of November. Although some Asian countries are departing from the zero-tolerance approach for COVID-19 measures as the vaccinated percentage of the region doubled in the last three months to almost 50%, several countries (including Japan, South Korea and Australia) promptly blocked travel from most countries or postponed reopenings. This adversely affect jet/kerosene margins. The Singapore jet/kerosene crack spread against Oman averaged $8.80/b, down by $2.83 m-o-m but up by $6.49 y-o-y. The Singapore gasoil crack spread declined following the robust performance of the previous month as refiners returned from maintenance. However, recovering regional demand, as well as expectations of a cold snap amid low inventories, could provide some support to crack spreads in the short term. The Singapore gasoil crack spread against Oman averaged $10.55/b, down by $1.37 m-o-m but up by $6.73 y-o-y. The Singapore fuel oil 3.5% crack spread weakened in response to ample supplies, high production rates in China and a decline in demand from Pakistan. In contrast, the low sulphur fuel oil market in Northeast Asia benefitted from robust demand from the power generation sector. The regional boost in refinery processing rates and government plans to release additional bunker fuel export quotas point to further pressure in the near term. Singapore fuel oil cracks against Oman averaged minus-$11.53/b, down by $4.88 m-o-m and $10.92 y-o-y.

For VLCCs, the spot freight rates on the Middle East-to-East route averaged WS43, up 2% m-o-m. While this represented an improvement over the same month last year, it is still well below pre-COVID levels for this time of year. For Suezmax, rates on the West Africa-to-US Gulf Coast (USGC) averaged WS61 for a decline of 6%. Aframax rates on the Med to Northwest Europe route averaged WS105, representing a gain of 2% m-o-m. In contrast, clean tanker spot rates strengthened, with gains both east and west of Suez. Middle East to East flows averaged WS118, indicating a gain of 4% m-o-m. Optimism for the end of the year has been shaken somewhat by the uncertainty around the impact of a new COVID-19 variant on economic activities. Spot fixtures The latest estimates show global spot fixtures declined in November, falling for the second-straight month. Fixtures averaged 13.23 mb/d, representing a decline of 2.5 mb/d, or 16%.

US crude exports averaged 2.9 mb/d, representing the second-consecutive monthly gain, amid higher flows to Asia. China’s crude imports averaged 8.9 mb/d in October, the lowest since February 2018, as independent refiners lacked import quotas and state-owned refiners were encouraged to draw down inventories. With the issuance of a final round of crude import quotas, preliminary data shows crude imports rebounded in November, averaging 10.2 mb/d. India’s crude imports declined in October after rising sharply over the previous two months to average 4.0 mb/d, amid the country’s peak holiday season. Crude imports are expected to recover in November, as the economy gains momentum and refiners boost runs. Japan’s crude imports fell further in October, averaging 2.4 mb/d and despite rising refinery runs. Product imports were flat, averaging 940 tb/d, as lower gasoline and naphtha inflows were offset by increased imports of heating fuels. The most recent data for OECD Europe shows crude imports remained strong in August, averaging 8.7mb/d. Crude exports continued to edge higher, increasing for the fourth consecutive month, to average 0.4 mb/d in August, amid higher flows to India and China. US Preliminary data shows US crude imports mostly recovered from a dip the previous month, averaging 6.4 mb/d in November. Crude inflows rose 0.3 mb/d m-o-m, or around 5%. Compared with the same month last year, crude imports were 0.8 mb/d, or 14%, higher. US crude exports averaged 2.9 mb/d in November, representing the second-straight month of gains, driven by higher flows to Asia, particularly South Korea. Exports rose 83 tb/d m-o-m, or 3%, and 0.1 mb/d, or 4%, compared with the same month last year.

OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report – December 2021 59 Crude and Refined Products Trade On the product side, preliminary data shows US product imports edged up following the previous month’s losses to average 2.1 mb/d. This represents a m-o-m increase of less than 2%. Compared with the same period last year, product imports were 3% higher. Product exports ticked higher, averaging 5.2 mb/d in November, amid higher distillate outflows. Product outflows were up by less than 2% m-o-m. Compared with the same month last year, product exports were also less than 2% higher. As a result, preliminary data shows US net product exports averaged around 3.1 mb/d in November, compared with 3.0 mb/d in October and 3.1 mb/d in the same month last year.

This compares with net imports of 0.2 mb/d the month before and net exports of almost 0.3 mb/d in November 2020. Looking ahead, US crude imports should pick up again in the final month of the year, while crude exports are expected to be capped at around current levels. Product flows should continue to be supported by seasonal demand. China China’s crude imports averaged 8.9 mb/d in October, the lowest since February 2018, as independent refiners lacked import quotas and state-owned refiners were encouraged to draw down inventories. M-o-m, crude imports were 1.1 mb/d, or almost 11%, lower. However, more recent data shows crude imports rebounded in November, averaging 10.2 mb/d, representing a m-o-m gain of 0.2 mb/d or around 2%. This followed with the issuance of a final round of crude import quotas. In terms of crude imports by source, Saudi Arabia remained in the top position in October, with a share of around 19%.
